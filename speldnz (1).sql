Orton, M.D. was one of the first researchers\n		 					to describe the emotional aspects of Dyslexia. According\n		 					to his research, the majority of dyslexic preschoolers \n		 					are happy and well adjusted. Their emotional problems \n		 					begin to develop when early reading instruction does not \n		 					match their learning style. Over the years, the frustration \n		 					mounts as classmates surpass the dyslexic student in reading \n		 					skills. Recent research funded by the National Institute of \n		 					Health has identified many of the neurological and cognitive \n		 					differences that contribute to Dyslexia. The vast majority of \n		 					these factors appear to be caused by genetics rather than poor \n		 					parenting or childhood depression or anxiety.</p>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>Why is Dyslexia discouraging and frustrating?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>The frustration of children with Dyslexia often \n		 					centres on their inability to meet expectations. Their \n		 					parents and teachers see a bright, enthusiastic child who \n		 					is not learning to read and write. Time and again, dyslexics \n		 					and their parents hear, “He’s such a bright child; if only he \n		 					would try harder.” Ironically, no one knows exactly how hard \n		 					the dyslexic is trying.</p>\n		 					<p>The pain of failing to meet other people’s \n		 					expectations is surpassed only by dyslexics’ \n		 					inability to achieve their goals. This is particularly \n		 					true of those who develop perfectionistic expectations \n		 					in order to deal with their anxiety. They grow up \n		 					believing that it is “terrible” to make a mistake. \n		 					However, their learning disability, almost by definition \n		 					means that these children will make many “careless” or \n		 					“stupid” mistakes. This is extremely frustrating to them, \n		 					as it makes them feel chronically inadequate.</p>\n		 					<p>The dyslexic frequently has problems with social \n		 					relationships. These can be traced to the following causes:</p>\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexic children may be physically and socially \n		 						immature in comparison to their peers. This can lead to \n		 						a poor self-image and less peer acceptance.</li>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexics’ social immaturity may make them awkward \n		 						in social situations.</li>\n		 						<li>- Many dyslexics have difficulty reading social cues. \n		 						They may be oblivious to the amount of personal distance \n		 						necessary in social interactions or insensitive to other \n		 						people’s body language.</li>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexia often affects oral language functioning. \n		 						Affected persons may have trouble finding the right words, \n		 						may stammer, or may pause before answering direct questions. \n		 						This puts them at a disadvantage as they enter adolescence, \n		 						when language becomes more central to their relationships \n		 						with peers.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 					\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>What does the dyslexic person feel?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<li><span>Anxiety</span>Anxiety is the most frequent emotional\n		 					 symptom reported by dyslexic adults. Dyslexics become fearful \n		 					 because of their constant frustration and confusion in school. \n		 					 These feelings are exacerbated by the inconsistencies of Dyslexia. \n		 					 Because they may anticipate failure, entering new situations can \n		 					 becomes extremely anxiety provoking. Anxiety causes human beings \n		 					 to avoid whatever frightens them. The dyslexic is no exception. \n		 					 However, many teachers and parents misinterpret this avoidance \n		 					 behaviour as laziness. In fact, the dyslexic’s hesitancy to \n		 					 participate in school activities such as homework is related \n		 					 more to anxiety and confusion than to apathy.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Anger</span>Many of the emotional problems caused by \n		 					Dyslexia occur out of frustration with school or social situations. \n		 					Social scientists have frequently observed that frustration produces \n		 					anger. This can be clearly seen in many dyslexics. The obvious target \n		 					of the dyslexic’s anger would be schools and teachers. However, it is \n		 					also common for the dyslexic to vent his anger on his parents. Mothers \n		 					are particularly likely to feel the dyslexic’s wrath. Often, the child \n		 					sits on his anger during school to the point of being extremely passive. \n		 					However, once he is in the safe environment of home, these very powerful \n		 					feelings erupt and are often directed toward the mother. Ironically, it \n		 					is the child’s trust of the mother that allows him to vent his anger. \n		 					However, this becomes very frustrating and confusing to the parent who \n		 					is desperately trying to help their child. As youngsters reach \n		 					adolescence, society expects them to become independent. The tension \n		 					between the expectation of independence and the child’s learned \n		 					dependence causes great internal conflicts. The adolescent dyslexic \n		 					uses his anger to break away from those people on which he feels so \n		 					dependent. Because of these factors, it may be difficult for parents \n		 					to help their teenage dyslexic. Instead, peer tutoring or a concerned \n		 					young adult may be better able to intervene and help the child.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Self Image</span>The dyslexic’s self-image appears to be \n		 					extremely vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. According to Erik \n		 					Erikson, during the first years of school, every child must resolve \n		 					the conflicts between a positive self-image and feelings of inferiority. \n		 					If children succeed in school, they will develop positive feelings about \n		 					themselves and believe that they can succeed in life. If children meet \n		 					failure and frustration, they learn that they are inferior to others, \n		 					and that their effort makes very little difference. Instead of feeling \n		 					powerful and productive, they learn that their environment controls them. \n		 					They feel powerless and incompetent. <br /><br />Researchers have learned \n		 					that when typical learners succeed, they credit their own efforts for their \n		 					success. When they fail, they tell themselves to try harder. However, when \n		 					the dyslexic succeeds, he is likely to attribute his success to luck. When \n		 					he fails, he simply sees himself as stupid.<br /><br />Research also suggests \n		 					that these feelings of inferiority develop by the age of ten. After this age, \n		 					it becomes extremely difficult to help the child develop a positive self-image. \n		 					This is a powerful argument for early intervention.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Depression</span>Depression is also a frequent complication in \n		 					Dyslexia. Although most dyslexics are not depressed, children with this \n		 					kind of learning disability are at higher risk for intense feelings of \n		 					sorrow and pain. Perhaps because of their low self-esteem, dyslexics are \n		 					afraid to turn their anger toward their environment and instead turn it \n		 					toward themselves. However, depressed children and adolescents often have \n		 					different symptoms than do depressed adults. The depressed child is unlikely \n		 					to be lethargic or to talk about feeling sad. Instead he or she may become \n		 					more active or misbehave to cover up the painful feelings. In the case of \n		 					masked depression, the child may not seem obviously unhappy. However, both \n		 					children and adults who are depressed tend to have three similar characteristics:\n		 					<br /><br />First, they tend to have negative thoughts about themselves, i.e. a \n		 					negative self-image. Second, they tend to view the world negatively. They are less \n		 					likely to enjoy the positive experiences in life. This makes it difficult for them \n		 					to have fun.<br /><br />Finally, most depressed youngsters have great trouble \n		 					imagining anything positive about the future. The depressed dyslexic not only \n		 					experiences great pain in his present experiences, but also foresees a life of \n		 					continuing failure.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Family Problems</span>Like any handicapping condition, Dyslexia has \n		 					a tremendous impact on the child’s family. However, because Dyslexia is an \n		 					invisible handicap, these effects are often overlooked. Dyslexia affects the \n		 					family in a variety of ways. One of the most obvious is sibling rivalry. \n		 					Non-dyslexic children often feel jealous of the dyslexic child, who gets the \n		 					majority of the parents’ attention, time, and money. Ironically, the dyslexic \n		 					child does not want this attention. This increases the chances that he or she \n		 					will act negatively against the achieving children in the family.<br /><br />Specific \n		 					developmental Dyslexia runs in families. This means that one or both of the child’s \n		 					parents may have had similar school problems. When faced with a child who is having \n		 					school problems, dyslexic parents may react in one of two ways. They may deny the \n		 					existence of Dyslexia and believe if the child would just buckle down, he or she \n		 					could succeed. Or, the parents may relive their failures and frustrations through \n		 					their child’s school experience. This brings back powerful and terrifying emotions, \n		 					which can interfere with the adult’s parenting skills.</li>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 				<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>How can parents and teachers help?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>Both teachers and parents need to offer consistent, ongoing encouragement \n		 					and support. However, one rarely hears about this very important way to help \n		 					youngsters. Encouragement involves at least four elements.</p>\n		 		\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Listening to children’s feelings. Anxiety, anger and depression \n		 						are daily companions for dyslexics. However, their language problems \n		 						often make it difficult for them to express their feelings. Therefore, \n		 						adults must help them learn to talk about their feelings.</li>\n		 						<li>- Teachers and parents must reward effort, not just “the product”. \n		 						For the dyslexic, grades should be less important than progress.</li>\n		 						<li>- When confronting unacceptable behaviour, adults must not \n		 						inadvertently discourage the dyslexic child. Words such as “lazy” \n		 						or “incorrigible” can seriously damage the child’s self-image.</li>\n		 						<li>- Help students set realistic goals for themselves. Most dyslexic \n		 						students set unattainable goals. By helping the child set an attainable \n		 						goal, teachers can change the cycle of failure.</li>\n		 						<li>- Even more important, the child needs to recognize and rejoice in \n		 						his or her successes. To do so, he or she needs to achieve success in \n		 						some area of life. In some cases, the dyslexic’s strengths are obvious, \n		 						and many dyslexics’ self-esteem has been salvaged by prowess in athletics, \n		 						art, or mechanics. However, the dyslexic’s strengths are often more subtle \n		 						and less obvious. Parents and teachers need to find ways to relate the \n		 						child’s interests to the demands of real life.</li>\n		 						<li>- Finally, many successful dyslexic adults deal with their own pain \n		 						by reaching out to others. They may do volunteer work for charities or \n		 						churches, or choose vocations that require empathy and a social conscience. \n		 						These experiences help dyslexics feel more positive about themselves and deal \n		 						more effectively with their pain and frustration. Many opportunities exist \n		 						in our schools, homes and churches for dyslexics to help others. One important \n		 						area is peer tutoring. If dyslexic students do well in math or science, \n		 						they can be asked to tutor a classmate who is struggling. Perhaps that student \n		 						can reciprocate as a reader for the dyslexic student. Tutoring younger children, \n		 						especially other dyslexics, can be a positive experience for everyone involved.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 		\n		 					<p>Helping dyslexics feel better about themselves and deal effectively with \n		 					their feelings is a complex task.

Orton, M.D. was one of the first researchers\n		 					to describe the emotional aspects of Dyslexia. According\n		 					to his research, the majority of dyslexic preschoolers \n		 					are happy and well adjusted. Their emotional problems \n		 					begin to develop when early reading instruction does not \n		 					match their learning style. Over the years, the frustration \n		 					mounts as classmates surpass the dyslexic student in reading \n		 					skills. Recent research funded by the National Institute of \n		 					Health has identified many of the neurological and cognitive \n		 					differences that contribute to Dyslexia. The vast majority of \n		 					these factors appear to be caused by genetics rather than poor \n		 					parenting or childhood depression or anxiety.</p>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>Why is Dyslexia discouraging and frustrating?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>The frustration of children with Dyslexia often \n		 					centres on their inability to meet expectations. Their \n		 					parents and teachers see a bright, enthusiastic child who \n		 					is not learning to read and write. Time and again, dyslexics \n		 					and their parents hear, “He’s such a bright child; if only he \n		 					would try harder.” Ironically, no one knows exactly how hard \n		 					the dyslexic is trying.</p>\n		 					<p>The pain of failing to meet other people’s \n		 					expectations is surpassed only by dyslexics’ \n		 					inability to achieve their goals. This is particularly \n		 					true of those who develop perfectionistic expectations \n		 					in order to deal with their anxiety. They grow up \n		 					believing that it is “terrible” to make a mistake. \n		 					However, their learning disability, almost by definition \n		 					means that these children will make many “careless” or \n		 					“stupid” mistakes. This is extremely frustrating to them, \n		 					as it makes them feel chronically inadequate.</p>\n		 					<p>The dyslexic frequently has problems with social \n		 					relationships. These can be traced to the following causes:</p>\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexic children may be physically and socially \n		 						immature in comparison to their peers. This can lead to \n		 						a poor self-image and less peer acceptance.</li>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexics’ social immaturity may make them awkward \n		 						in social situations.</li>\n		 						<li>- Many dyslexics have difficulty reading social cues. \n		 						They may be oblivious to the amount of personal distance \n		 						necessary in social interactions or insensitive to other \n		 						people’s body language.</li>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexia often affects oral language functioning. \n		 						Affected persons may have trouble finding the right words, \n		 						may stammer, or may pause before answering direct questions. \n		 						This puts them at a disadvantage as they enter adolescence, \n		 						when language becomes more central to their relationships \n		 						with peers.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 					\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>What does the dyslexic person feel?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<li><span>Anxiety</span>Anxiety is the most frequent emotional\n		 					 symptom reported by dyslexic adults. Dyslexics become fearful \n		 					 because of their constant frustration and confusion in school. \n		 					 These feelings are exacerbated by the inconsistencies of Dyslexia. \n		 					 Because they may anticipate failure, entering new situations can \n		 					 becomes extremely anxiety provoking. Anxiety causes human beings \n		 					 to avoid whatever frightens them. The dyslexic is no exception. \n		 					 However, many teachers and parents misinterpret this avoidance \n		 					 behaviour as laziness. In fact, the dyslexic’s hesitancy to \n		 					 participate in school activities such as homework is related \n		 					 more to anxiety and confusion than to apathy.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Anger</span>Many of the emotional problems caused by \n		 					Dyslexia occur out of frustration with school or social situations. \n		 					Social scientists have frequently observed that frustration produces \n		 					anger. This can be clearly seen in many dyslexics. The obvious target \n		 					of the dyslexic’s anger would be schools and teachers. However, it is \n		 					also common for the dyslexic to vent his anger on his parents. Mothers \n		 					are particularly likely to feel the dyslexic’s wrath. Often, the child \n		 					sits on his anger during school to the point of being extremely passive. \n		 					However, once he is in the safe environment of home, these very powerful \n		 					feelings erupt and are often directed toward the mother. Ironically, it \n		 					is the child’s trust of the mother that allows him to vent his anger. \n		 					However, this becomes very frustrating and confusing to the parent who \n		 					is desperately trying to help their child. As youngsters reach \n		 					adolescence, society expects them to become independent. The tension \n		 					between the expectation of independence and the child’s learned \n		 					dependence causes great internal conflicts. The adolescent dyslexic \n		 					uses his anger to break away from those people on which he feels so \n		 					dependent. Because of these factors, it may be difficult for parents \n		 					to help their teenage dyslexic. Instead, peer tutoring or a concerned \n		 					young adult may be better able to intervene and help the child.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Self Image</span>The dyslexic’s self-image appears to be \n		 					extremely vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. According to Erik \n		 					Erikson, during the first years of school, every child must resolve \n		 					the conflicts between a positive self-image and feelings of inferiority. \n		 					If children succeed in school, they will develop positive feelings about \n		 					themselves and believe that they can succeed in life. If children meet \n		 					failure and frustration, they learn that they are inferior to others, \n		 					and that their effort makes very little difference. Instead of feeling \n		 					powerful and productive, they learn that their environment controls them. \n		 					They feel powerless and incompetent. <br /><br />Researchers have learned \n		 					that when typical learners succeed, they credit their own efforts for their \n		 					success. When they fail, they tell themselves to try harder. However, when \n		 					the dyslexic succeeds, he is likely to attribute his success to luck. When \n		 					he fails, he simply sees himself as stupid.<br /><br />Research also suggests \n		 					that these feelings of inferiority develop by the age of ten. After this age, \n		 					it becomes extremely difficult to help the child develop a positive self-image. \n		 					This is a powerful argument for early intervention.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Depression</span>Depression is also a frequent complication in \n		 					Dyslexia. Although most dyslexics are not depressed, children with this \n		 					kind of learning disability are at higher risk for intense feelings of \n		 					sorrow and pain. Perhaps because of their low self-esteem, dyslexics are \n		 					afraid to turn their anger toward their environment and instead turn it \n		 					toward themselves. However, depressed children and adolescents often have \n		 					different symptoms than do depressed adults. The depressed child is unlikely \n		 					to be lethargic or to talk about feeling sad. Instead he or she may become \n		 					more active or misbehave to cover up the painful feelings. In the case of \n		 					masked depression, the child may not seem obviously unhappy. However, both \n		 					children and adults who are depressed tend to have three similar characteristics:\n		 					<br /><br />First, they tend to have negative thoughts about themselves, i.e. a \n		 					negative self-image. Second, they tend to view the world negatively. They are less \n		 					likely to enjoy the positive experiences in life. This makes it difficult for them \n		 					to have fun.<br /><br />Finally, most depressed youngsters have great trouble \n		 					imagining anything positive about the future. The depressed dyslexic not only \n		 					experiences great pain in his present experiences, but also foresees a life of \n		 					continuing failure.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Family Problems</span>Like any handicapping condition, Dyslexia has \n		 					a tremendous impact on the child’s family. However, because Dyslexia is an \n		 					invisible handicap, these effects are often overlooked. Dyslexia affects the \n		 					family in a variety of ways. One of the most obvious is sibling rivalry. \n		 					Non-dyslexic children often feel jealous of the dyslexic child, who gets the \n		 					majority of the parents’ attention, time, and money. Ironically, the dyslexic \n		 					child does not want this attention. This increases the chances that he or she \n		 					will act negatively against the achieving children in the family.<br /><br />Specific \n		 					developmental Dyslexia runs in families. This means that one or both of the child’s \n		 					parents may have had similar school problems. When faced with a child who is having \n		 					school problems, dyslexic parents may react in one of two ways. They may deny the \n		 					existence of Dyslexia and believe if the child would just buckle down, he or she \n		 					could succeed. Or, the parents may relive their failures and frustrations through \n		 					their child’s school experience. This brings back powerful and terrifying emotions, \n		 					which can interfere with the adult’s parenting skills.</li>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 				<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>How can parents and teachers help?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>Both teachers and parents need to offer consistent, ongoing encouragement \n		 					and support. However, one rarely hears about this very important way to help \n		 					youngsters. Encouragement involves at least four elements.</p>\n		 		\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Listening to children’s feelings. Anxiety, anger and depression \n		 						are daily companions for dyslexics. However, their language problems \n		 						often make it difficult for them to express their feelings. Therefore, \n		 						adults must help them learn to talk about their feelings.</li>\n		 						<li>- Teachers and parents must reward effort, not just “the product”. \n		 						For the dyslexic, grades should be less important than progress.</li>\n		 						<li>- When confronting unacceptable behaviour, adults must not \n		 						inadvertently discourage the dyslexic child. Words such as “lazy” \n		 						or “incorrigible” can seriously damage the child’s self-image.</li>\n		 						<li>- Help students set realistic goals for themselves. Most dyslexic \n		 						students set unattainable goals. By helping the child set an attainable \n		 						goal, teachers can change the cycle of failure.</li>\n		 						<li>- Even more important, the child needs to recognize and rejoice in \n		 						his or her successes. To do so, he or she needs to achieve success in \n		 						some area of life. In some cases, the dyslexic’s strengths are obvious, \n		 						and many dyslexics’ self-esteem has been salvaged by prowess in athletics, \n		 						art, or mechanics. However, the dyslexic’s strengths are often more subtle \n		 						and less obvious. Parents and teachers need to find ways to relate the \n		 						child’s interests to the demands of real life.</li>\n		 						<li>- Finally, many successful dyslexic adults deal with their own pain \n		 						by reaching out to others. They may do volunteer work for charities or \n		 						churches, or choose vocations that require empathy and a social conscience. \n		 						These experiences help dyslexics feel more positive about themselves and deal \n		 						more effectively with their pain and frustration. Many opportunities exist \n		 						in our schools, homes and churches for dyslexics to help others. One important \n		 						area is peer tutoring. If dyslexic students do well in math or science, \n		 						they can be asked to tutor a classmate who is struggling. Perhaps that student \n		 						can reciprocate as a reader for the dyslexic student. Tutoring younger children, \n		 						especially other dyslexics, can be a positive experience for everyone involved.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 		\n		 					<p>Helping dyslexics feel better about themselves and deal effectively with \n		 					their feelings is a complex task. First, caring adults must understand the \n		 					cognitive and affective problems caused by Dyslexia. Then they must design \n		 					strategies that will help the dyslexic, like every other child, to find joy \n		 					and success in academics and personal relationships.</p>\n		 					<p>Thank you to the International Dyslexia Association</p>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 	</div><!-- learning-dyslexia -->\n	<!-- Dyslexia -->\n		 	<div class="five Dyspraxia" data-shown="0">\n				<p>Dyspraxia<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></p>\n			</div>\n			<div class="learning-five">\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>What is Dyspraxia?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>`Developmental Dyspraxia (also known as Developmental \n		 						Coordination Disorder and the Clumsy Child Syndrome)\n		 						is a neurologically based disorder of motor function, \n		 						affecting the gaining of new skills and the carrying \n		 						out of those already learned.’</p>\n		 					<p>It affects children in different ways at different \n		 						stages of development, and is inconsistent – as if \n		 						sometimes information is `put away’ in the wrong \n		 						drawer.</p>\n		 					<p>It is not a behaviour problem, not an overt physical \n		 						disability, and may not even be visible – until the \n		 						child tries to learn a new skill, or to repeat a \n		 						learned one out of context.

People with Dyslexia \n	 						and those with ADHD both have difficulty with reading.

Their \n		 					parents and teachers see a bright, enthusiastic child who \n		 					is not learning to read and write. Time and again, dyslexics \n		 					and their parents hear, “He’s such a bright child; if only he \n		 					would try harder.” Ironically, no one knows exactly how hard \n		 					the dyslexic is trying.</p>\n		 					<p>The pain of failing to meet other people’s \n		 					expectations is surpassed only by dyslexics’ \n		 					inability to achieve their goals. This is particularly \n		 					true of those who develop perfectionistic expectations \n		 					in order to deal with their anxiety. They grow up \n		 					believing that it is “terrible” to make a mistake. \n		 					However, their learning disability, almost by definition \n		 					means that these children will make many “careless” or \n		 					“stupid” mistakes. This is extremely frustrating to them, \n		 					as it makes them feel chronically inadequate.</p>\n		 					<p>The dyslexic frequently has problems with social \n		 					relationships. These can be traced to the following causes:</p>\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexic children may be physically and socially \n		 						immature in comparison to their peers. This can lead to \n		 						a poor self-image and less peer acceptance.</li>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexics’ social immaturity may make them awkward \n		 						in social situations.</li>\n		 						<li>- Many dyslexics have difficulty reading social cues. \n		 						They may be oblivious to the amount of personal distance \n		 						necessary in social interactions or insensitive to other \n		 						people’s body language.</li>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexia often affects oral language functioning. \n		 						Affected persons may have trouble finding the right words, \n		 						may stammer, or may pause before answering direct questions. \n		 						This puts them at a disadvantage as they enter adolescence, \n		 						when language becomes more central to their relationships \n		 						with peers.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 					\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>What does the dyslexic person feel?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<li><span>Anxiety</span>Anxiety is the most frequent emotional\n		 					 symptom reported by dyslexic adults. Dyslexics become fearful \n		 					 because of their constant frustration and confusion in school. \n		 					 These feelings are exacerbated by the inconsistencies of Dyslexia. \n		 					 Because they may anticipate failure, entering new situations can \n		 					 becomes extremely anxiety provoking. Anxiety causes human beings \n		 					 to avoid whatever frightens them. The dyslexic is no exception. \n		 					 However, many teachers and parents misinterpret this avoidance \n		 					 behaviour as laziness. In fact, the dyslexic’s hesitancy to \n		 					 participate in school activities such as homework is related \n		 					 more to anxiety and confusion than to apathy.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Anger</span>Many of the emotional problems caused by \n		 					Dyslexia occur out of frustration with school or social situations. \n		 					Social scientists have frequently observed that frustration produces \n		 					anger. This can be clearly seen in many dyslexics. The obvious target \n		 					of the dyslexic’s anger would be schools and teachers. However, it is \n		 					also common for the dyslexic to vent his anger on his parents. Mothers \n		 					are particularly likely to feel the dyslexic’s wrath. Often, the child \n		 					sits on his anger during school to the point of being extremely passive. \n		 					However, once he is in the safe environment of home, these very powerful \n		 					feelings erupt and are often directed toward the mother. Ironically, it \n		 					is the child’s trust of the mother that allows him to vent his anger. \n		 					However, this becomes very frustrating and confusing to the parent who \n		 					is desperately trying to help their child. As youngsters reach \n		 					adolescence, society expects them to become independent. The tension \n		 					between the expectation of independence and the child’s learned \n		 					dependence causes great internal conflicts. The adolescent dyslexic \n		 					uses his anger to break away from those people on which he feels so \n		 					dependent. Because of these factors, it may be difficult for parents \n		 					to help their teenage dyslexic. Instead, peer tutoring or a concerned \n		 					young adult may be better able to intervene and help the child.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Self Image</span>The dyslexic’s self-image appears to be \n		 					extremely vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. According to Erik \n		 					Erikson, during the first years of school, every child must resolve \n		 					the conflicts between a positive self-image and feelings of inferiority. \n		 					If children succeed in school, they will develop positive feelings about \n		 					themselves and believe that they can succeed in life. If children meet \n		 					failure and frustration, they learn that they are inferior to others, \n		 					and that their effort makes very little difference. Instead of feeling \n		 					powerful and productive, they learn that their environment controls them. \n		 					They feel powerless and incompetent. <br /><br />Researchers have learned \n		 					that when typical learners succeed, they credit their own efforts for their \n		 					success. When they fail, they tell themselves to try harder. However, when \n		 					the dyslexic succeeds, he is likely to attribute his success to luck. When \n		 					he fails, he simply sees himself as stupid.<br /><br />Research also suggests \n		 					that these feelings of inferiority develop by the age of ten. After this age, \n		 					it becomes extremely difficult to help the child develop a positive self-image. \n		 					This is a powerful argument for early intervention.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Depression</span>Depression is also a frequent complication in \n		 					Dyslexia. Although most dyslexics are not depressed, children with this \n		 					kind of learning disability are at higher risk for intense feelings of \n		 					sorrow and pain. Perhaps because of their low self-esteem, dyslexics are \n		 					afraid to turn their anger toward their environment and instead turn it \n		 					toward themselves. However, depressed children and adolescents often have \n		 					different symptoms than do depressed adults. The depressed child is unlikely \n		 					to be lethargic or to talk about feeling sad. Instead he or she may become \n		 					more active or misbehave to cover up the painful feelings. In the case of \n		 					masked depression, the child may not seem obviously unhappy. However, both \n		 					children and adults who are depressed tend to have three similar characteristics:\n		 					<br /><br />First, they tend to have negative thoughts about themselves, i.e. a \n		 					negative self-image. Second, they tend to view the world negatively. They are less \n		 					likely to enjoy the positive experiences in life. This makes it difficult for them \n		 					to have fun.<br /><br />Finally, most depressed youngsters have great trouble \n		 					imagining anything positive about the future. The depressed dyslexic not only \n		 					experiences great pain in his present experiences, but also foresees a life of \n		 					continuing failure.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Family Problems</span>Like any handicapping condition, Dyslexia has \n		 					a tremendous impact on the child’s family. However, because Dyslexia is an \n		 					invisible handicap, these effects are often overlooked. Dyslexia affects the \n		 					family in a variety of ways. One of the most obvious is sibling rivalry. \n		 					Non-dyslexic children often feel jealous of the dyslexic child, who gets the \n		 					majority of the parents’ attention, time, and money. Ironically, the dyslexic \n		 					child does not want this attention. This increases the chances that he or she \n		 					will act negatively against the achieving children in the family.<br /><br />Specific \n		 					developmental Dyslexia runs in families. This means that one or both of the child’s \n		 					parents may have had similar school problems. When faced with a child who is having \n		 					school problems, dyslexic parents may react in one of two ways. They may deny the \n		 					existence of Dyslexia and believe if the child would just buckle down, he or she \n		 					could succeed. Or, the parents may relive their failures and frustrations through \n		 					their child’s school experience. This brings back powerful and terrifying emotions, \n		 					which can interfere with the adult’s parenting skills.</li>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 				<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>How can parents and teachers help?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>Both teachers and parents need to offer consistent, ongoing encouragement \n		 					and support. However, one rarely hears about this very important way to help \n		 					youngsters. Encouragement involves at least four elements.</p>\n		 		\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Listening to children’s feelings. Anxiety, anger and depression \n		 						are daily companions for dyslexics. However, their language problems \n		 						often make it difficult for them to express their feelings. Therefore, \n		 						adults must help them learn to talk about their feelings.</li>\n		 						<li>- Teachers and parents must reward effort, not just “the product”. \n		 						For the dyslexic, grades should be less important than progress.</li>\n		 						<li>- When confronting unacceptable behaviour, adults must not \n		 						inadvertently discourage the dyslexic child. Words such as “lazy” \n		 						or “incorrigible” can seriously damage the child’s self-image.</li>\n		 						<li>- Help students set realistic goals for themselves. Most dyslexic \n		 						students set unattainable goals. By helping the child set an attainable \n		 						goal, teachers can change the cycle of failure.</li>\n		 						<li>- Even more important, the child needs to recognize and rejoice in \n		 						his or her successes. To do so, he or she needs to achieve success in \n		 						some area of life. In some cases, the dyslexic’s strengths are obvious, \n		 						and many dyslexics’ self-esteem has been salvaged by prowess in athletics, \n		 						art, or mechanics. However, the dyslexic’s strengths are often more subtle \n		 						and less obvious. Parents and teachers need to find ways to relate the \n		 						child’s interests to the demands of real life.</li>\n		 						<li>- Finally, many successful dyslexic adults deal with their own pain \n		 						by reaching out to others. They may do volunteer work for charities or \n		 						churches, or choose vocations that require empathy and a social conscience. \n		 						These experiences help dyslexics feel more positive about themselves and deal \n		 						more effectively with their pain and frustration. Many opportunities exist \n		 						in our schools, homes and churches for dyslexics to help others. One important \n		 						area is peer tutoring. If dyslexic students do well in math or science, \n		 						they can be asked to tutor a classmate who is struggling. Perhaps that student \n		 						can reciprocate as a reader for the dyslexic student. Tutoring younger children, \n		 						especially other dyslexics, can be a positive experience for everyone involved.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 		\n		 					<p>Helping dyslexics feel better about themselves and deal effectively with \n		 					their feelings is a complex task. First, caring adults must understand the \n		 					cognitive and affective problems caused by Dyslexia. Then they must design \n		 					strategies that will help the dyslexic, like every other child, to find joy \n		 					and success in academics and personal relationships.</p>\n		 					<p>Thank you to the International Dyslexia Association</p>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 	</div><!-- learning-dyslexia -->\n	<!-- Dyslexia -->\n		 	<div class="five Dyspraxia" data-shown="0">\n				<p>Dyspraxia<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></p>\n			</div>\n			<div class="learning-five">\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>What is Dyspraxia?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>`Developmental Dyspraxia (also known as Developmental \n		 						Coordination Disorder and the Clumsy Child Syndrome)\n		 						is a neurologically based disorder of motor function, \n		 						affecting the gaining of new skills and the carrying \n		 						out of those already learned.’</p>\n		 					<p>It affects children in different ways at different \n		 						stages of development, and is inconsistent – as if \n		 						sometimes information is `put away’ in the wrong \n		 						drawer.</p>\n		 					<p>It is not a behaviour problem, not an overt physical \n		 						disability, and may not even be visible – until the \n		 						child tries to learn a new skill, or to repeat a \n		 						learned one out of context.

Some dyslexics manage to learn early \n		 					reading and spelling tasks, especially with \n		 					excellent instruction, but later experience their\n		 					most debilitating problems when more complex \n		 					language skills are required, such as grammar, \n		 					understanding textbook material, and writing essays.\n		 					People with Dyslexia can also have problems with \n		 					spoken language, even after they have been exposed\n		 					to good language models in their homes and good\n		 					language instruction in school. They may find\n		 					it difficult to express themselves clearly, or\n		 					to fully comprehend what others mean when they\n		 					speak. Such language problems are often \n		 					difficult to recognize, but they can lead\n		 					to major problems in school, in the workplace,\n		 					and in relating to other people.

Orton, M.D. was one of the first researchers\n		 					to describe the emotional aspects of Dyslexia. According\n		 					to his research, the majority of dyslexic preschoolers \n		 					are happy and well adjusted. Their emotional problems \n		 					begin to develop when early reading instruction does not \n		 					match their learning style. Over the years, the frustration \n		 					mounts as classmates surpass the dyslexic student in reading \n		 					skills. Recent research funded by the National Institute of \n		 					Health has identified many of the neurological and cognitive \n		 					differences that contribute to Dyslexia. The vast majority of \n		 					these factors appear to be caused by genetics rather than poor \n		 					parenting or childhood depression or anxiety.</p>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>Why is Dyslexia discouraging and frustrating?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>The frustration of children with Dyslexia often \n		 					centres on their inability to meet expectations. Their \n		 					parents and teachers see a bright, enthusiastic child who \n		 					is not learning to read and write. Time and again, dyslexics \n		 					and their parents hear, “He’s such a bright child; if only he \n		 					would try harder.” Ironically, no one knows exactly how hard \n		 					the dyslexic is trying.</p>\n		 					<p>The pain of failing to meet other people’s \n		 					expectations is surpassed only by dyslexics’ \n		 					inability to achieve their goals. This is particularly \n		 					true of those who develop perfectionistic expectations \n		 					in order to deal with their anxiety. They grow up \n		 					believing that it is “terrible” to make a mistake. \n		 					However, their learning disability, almost by definition \n		 					means that these children will make many “careless” or \n		 					“stupid” mistakes. This is extremely frustrating to them, \n		 					as it makes them feel chronically inadequate.</p>\n		 					<p>The dyslexic frequently has problems with social \n		 					relationships. These can be traced to the following causes:</p>\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexic children may be physically and socially \n		 						immature in comparison to their peers. This can lead to \n		 						a poor self-image and less peer acceptance.</li>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexics’ social immaturity may make them awkward \n		 						in social situations.</li>\n		 						<li>- Many dyslexics have difficulty reading social cues. \n		 						They may be oblivious to the amount of personal distance \n		 						necessary in social interactions or insensitive to other \n		 						people’s body language.</li>\n		 						<li>- Dyslexia often affects oral language functioning. \n		 						Affected persons may have trouble finding the right words, \n		 						may stammer, or may pause before answering direct questions. \n		 						This puts them at a disadvantage as they enter adolescence, \n		 						when language becomes more central to their relationships \n		 						with peers.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 					\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>What does the dyslexic person feel?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<li><span>Anxiety</span>Anxiety is the most frequent emotional\n		 					 symptom reported by dyslexic adults. Dyslexics become fearful \n		 					 because of their constant frustration and confusion in school. \n		 					 These feelings are exacerbated by the inconsistencies of Dyslexia. \n		 					 Because they may anticipate failure, entering new situations can \n		 					 becomes extremely anxiety provoking. Anxiety causes human beings \n		 					 to avoid whatever frightens them. The dyslexic is no exception. \n		 					 However, many teachers and parents misinterpret this avoidance \n		 					 behaviour as laziness. In fact, the dyslexic’s hesitancy to \n		 					 participate in school activities such as homework is related \n		 					 more to anxiety and confusion than to apathy.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Anger</span>Many of the emotional problems caused by \n		 					Dyslexia occur out of frustration with school or social situations. \n		 					Social scientists have frequently observed that frustration produces \n		 					anger. This can be clearly seen in many dyslexics. The obvious target \n		 					of the dyslexic’s anger would be schools and teachers. However, it is \n		 					also common for the dyslexic to vent his anger on his parents. Mothers \n		 					are particularly likely to feel the dyslexic’s wrath. Often, the child \n		 					sits on his anger during school to the point of being extremely passive. \n		 					However, once he is in the safe environment of home, these very powerful \n		 					feelings erupt and are often directed toward the mother. Ironically, it \n		 					is the child’s trust of the mother that allows him to vent his anger. \n		 					However, this becomes very frustrating and confusing to the parent who \n		 					is desperately trying to help their child. As youngsters reach \n		 					adolescence, society expects them to become independent. The tension \n		 					between the expectation of independence and the child’s learned \n		 					dependence causes great internal conflicts. The adolescent dyslexic \n		 					uses his anger to break away from those people on which he feels so \n		 					dependent. Because of these factors, it may be difficult for parents \n		 					to help their teenage dyslexic. Instead, peer tutoring or a concerned \n		 					young adult may be better able to intervene and help the child.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Self Image</span>The dyslexic’s self-image appears to be \n		 					extremely vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. According to Erik \n		 					Erikson, during the first years of school, every child must resolve \n		 					the conflicts between a positive self-image and feelings of inferiority. \n		 					If children succeed in school, they will develop positive feelings about \n		 					themselves and believe that they can succeed in life. If children meet \n		 					failure and frustration, they learn that they are inferior to others, \n		 					and that their effort makes very little difference. Instead of feeling \n		 					powerful and productive, they learn that their environment controls them. \n		 					They feel powerless and incompetent. <br /><br />Researchers have learned \n		 					that when typical learners succeed, they credit their own efforts for their \n		 					success. When they fail, they tell themselves to try harder. However, when \n		 					the dyslexic succeeds, he is likely to attribute his success to luck. When \n		 					he fails, he simply sees himself as stupid.<br /><br />Research also suggests \n		 					that these feelings of inferiority develop by the age of ten. After this age, \n		 					it becomes extremely difficult to help the child develop a positive self-image. \n		 					This is a powerful argument for early intervention.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Depression</span>Depression is also a frequent complication in \n		 					Dyslexia. Although most dyslexics are not depressed, children with this \n		 					kind of learning disability are at higher risk for intense feelings of \n		 					sorrow and pain. Perhaps because of their low self-esteem, dyslexics are \n		 					afraid to turn their anger toward their environment and instead turn it \n		 					toward themselves. However, depressed children and adolescents often have \n		 					different symptoms than do depressed adults. The depressed child is unlikely \n		 					to be lethargic or to talk about feeling sad. Instead he or she may become \n		 					more active or misbehave to cover up the painful feelings. In the case of \n		 					masked depression, the child may not seem obviously unhappy. However, both \n		 					children and adults who are depressed tend to have three similar characteristics:\n		 					<br /><br />First, they tend to have negative thoughts about themselves, i.e. a \n		 					negative self-image. Second, they tend to view the world negatively. They are less \n		 					likely to enjoy the positive experiences in life. This makes it difficult for them \n		 					to have fun.<br /><br />Finally, most depressed youngsters have great trouble \n		 					imagining anything positive about the future. The depressed dyslexic not only \n		 					experiences great pain in his present experiences, but also foresees a life of \n		 					continuing failure.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Family Problems</span>Like any handicapping condition, Dyslexia has \n		 					a tremendous impact on the child’s family. However, because Dyslexia is an \n		 					invisible handicap, these effects are often overlooked. Dyslexia affects the \n		 					family in a variety of ways. One of the most obvious is sibling rivalry. \n		 					Non-dyslexic children often feel jealous of the dyslexic child, who gets the \n		 					majority of the parents’ attention, time, and money. Ironically, the dyslexic \n		 					child does not want this attention. This increases the chances that he or she \n		 					will act negatively against the achieving children in the family.<br /><br />Specific \n		 					developmental Dyslexia runs in families. This means that one or both of the child’s \n		 					parents may have had similar school problems. When faced with a child who is having \n		 					school problems, dyslexic parents may react in one of two ways. They may deny the \n		 					existence of Dyslexia and believe if the child would just buckle down, he or she \n		 					could succeed. Or, the parents may relive their failures and frustrations through \n		 					their child’s school experience. This brings back powerful and terrifying emotions, \n		 					which can interfere with the adult’s parenting skills.</li>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 				<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>How can parents and teachers help?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>Both teachers and parents need to offer consistent, ongoing encouragement \n		 					and support. However, one rarely hears about this very important way to help \n		 					youngsters. Encouragement involves at least four elements.</p>\n		 		\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Listening to children’s feelings. Anxiety, anger and depression \n		 						are daily companions for dyslexics. However, their language problems \n		 						often make it difficult for them to express their feelings. Therefore, \n		 						adults must help them learn to talk about their feelings.</li>\n		 						<li>- Teachers and parents must reward effort, not just “the product”. \n		 						For the dyslexic, grades should be less important than progress.</li>\n		 						<li>- When confronting unacceptable behaviour, adults must not \n		 						inadvertently discourage the dyslexic child. Words such as “lazy” \n		 						or “incorrigible” can seriously damage the child’s self-image.</li>\n		 						<li>- Help students set realistic goals for themselves. Most dyslexic \n		 						students set unattainable goals. By helping the child set an attainable \n		 						goal, teachers can change the cycle of failure.</li>\n		 						<li>- Even more important, the child needs to recognize and rejoice in \n		 						his or her successes. To do so, he or she needs to achieve success in \n		 						some area of life. In some cases, the dyslexic’s strengths are obvious, \n		 						and many dyslexics’ self-esteem has been salvaged by prowess in athletics, \n		 						art, or mechanics. However, the dyslexic’s strengths are often more subtle \n		 						and less obvious. Parents and teachers need to find ways to relate the \n		 						child’s interests to the demands of real life.</li>\n		 						<li>- Finally, many successful dyslexic adults deal with their own pain \n		 						by reaching out to others. They may do volunteer work for charities or \n		 						churches, or choose vocations that require empathy and a social conscience. \n		 						These experiences help dyslexics feel more positive about themselves and deal \n		 						more effectively with their pain and frustration. Many opportunities exist \n		 						in our schools, homes and churches for dyslexics to help others. One important \n		 						area is peer tutoring. If dyslexic students do well in math or science, \n		 						they can be asked to tutor a classmate who is struggling. Perhaps that student \n		 						can reciprocate as a reader for the dyslexic student. Tutoring younger children, \n		 						especially other dyslexics, can be a positive experience for everyone involved.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 		\n		 					<p>Helping dyslexics feel better about themselves and deal effectively with \n		 					their feelings is a complex task. First, caring adults must understand the \n		 					cognitive and affective problems caused by Dyslexia. Then they must design \n		 					strategies that will help the dyslexic, like every other child, to find joy \n		 					and success in academics and personal relationships.</p>\n		 					<p>Thank you to the International Dyslexia Association</p>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 	</div><!-- learning-dyslexia -->\n	<!-- Dyslexia -->\n		 	<div class="five Dyspraxia" data-shown="0">\n				<p>Dyspraxia<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></p>\n			</div>\n			<div class="learning-five">\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>What is Dyspraxia?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>`Developmental Dyspraxia (also known as Developmental \n		 						Coordination Disorder and the Clumsy Child Syndrome)\n		 						is a neurologically based disorder of motor function, \n		 						affecting the gaining of new skills and the carrying \n		 						out of those already learned.’</p>\n		 					<p>It affects children in different ways at different \n		 						stages of development, and is inconsistent – as if \n		 						sometimes information is `put away’ in the wrong \n		 						drawer.</p>\n		 					<p>It is not a behaviour problem, not an overt physical \n		 						disability, and may not even be visible – until the \n		 						child tries to learn a new skill, or to repeat a \n		 						learned one out of context.

However, it is \n		 					also common for the dyslexic to vent his anger on his parents. Mothers \n		 					are particularly likely to feel the dyslexic’s wrath. Often, the child \n		 					sits on his anger during school to the point of being extremely passive. \n		 					However, once he is in the safe environment of home, these very powerful \n		 					feelings erupt and are often directed toward the mother. Ironically, it \n		 					is the child’s trust of the mother that allows him to vent his anger. \n		 					However, this becomes very frustrating and confusing to the parent who \n		 					is desperately trying to help their child. As youngsters reach \n		 					adolescence, society expects them to become independent. The tension \n		 					between the expectation of independence and the child’s learned \n		 					dependence causes great internal conflicts. The adolescent dyslexic \n		 					uses his anger to break away from those people on which he feels so \n		 					dependent. Because of these factors, it may be difficult for parents \n		 					to help their teenage dyslexic. Instead, peer tutoring or a concerned \n		 					young adult may be better able to intervene and help the child.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Self Image</span>The dyslexic’s self-image appears to be \n		 					extremely vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. According to Erik \n		 					Erikson, during the first years of school, every child must resolve \n		 					the conflicts between a positive self-image and feelings of inferiority. \n		 					If children succeed in school, they will develop positive feelings about \n		 					themselves and believe that they can succeed in life. If children meet \n		 					failure and frustration, they learn that they are inferior to others, \n		 					and that their effort makes very little difference. Instead of feeling \n		 					powerful and productive, they learn that their environment controls them. \n		 					They feel powerless and incompetent. <br /><br />Researchers have learned \n		 					that when typical learners succeed, they credit their own efforts for their \n		 					success. When they fail, they tell themselves to try harder. However, when \n		 					the dyslexic succeeds, he is likely to attribute his success to luck. When \n		 					he fails, he simply sees himself as stupid.<br /><br />Research also suggests \n		 					that these feelings of inferiority develop by the age of ten. After this age, \n		 					it becomes extremely difficult to help the child develop a positive self-image. \n		 					This is a powerful argument for early intervention.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Depression</span>Depression is also a frequent complication in \n		 					Dyslexia. Although most dyslexics are not depressed, children with this \n		 					kind of learning disability are at higher risk for intense feelings of \n		 					sorrow and pain. Perhaps because of their low self-esteem, dyslexics are \n		 					afraid to turn their anger toward their environment and instead turn it \n		 					toward themselves. However, depressed children and adolescents often have \n		 					different symptoms than do depressed adults. The depressed child is unlikely \n		 					to be lethargic or to talk about feeling sad. Instead he or she may become \n		 					more active or misbehave to cover up the painful feelings. In the case of \n		 					masked depression, the child may not seem obviously unhappy. However, both \n		 					children and adults who are depressed tend to have three similar characteristics:\n		 					<br /><br />First, they tend to have negative thoughts about themselves, i.e. a \n		 					negative self-image. Second, they tend to view the world negatively. They are less \n		 					likely to enjoy the positive experiences in life. This makes it difficult for them \n		 					to have fun.<br /><br />Finally, most depressed youngsters have great trouble \n		 					imagining anything positive about the future. The depressed dyslexic not only \n		 					experiences great pain in his present experiences, but also foresees a life of \n		 					continuing failure.</li>\n		 					<li><span>Family Problems</span>Like any handicapping condition, Dyslexia has \n		 					a tremendous impact on the child’s family. However, because Dyslexia is an \n		 					invisible handicap, these effects are often overlooked. Dyslexia affects the \n		 					family in a variety of ways. One of the most obvious is sibling rivalry. \n		 					Non-dyslexic children often feel jealous of the dyslexic child, who gets the \n		 					majority of the parents’ attention, time, and money. Ironically, the dyslexic \n		 					child does not want this attention. This increases the chances that he or she \n		 					will act negatively against the achieving children in the family.<br /><br />Specific \n		 					developmental Dyslexia runs in families. This means that one or both of the child’s \n		 					parents may have had similar school problems. When faced with a child who is having \n		 					school problems, dyslexic parents may react in one of two ways. They may deny the \n		 					existence of Dyslexia and believe if the child would just buckle down, he or she \n		 					could succeed. Or, the parents may relive their failures and frustrations through \n		 					their child’s school experience. This brings back powerful and terrifying emotions, \n		 					which can interfere with the adult’s parenting skills.</li>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 		\n		 				<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>How can parents and teachers help?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>Both teachers and parents need to offer consistent, ongoing encouragement \n		 					and support. However, one rarely hears about this very important way to help \n		 					youngsters. Encouragement involves at least four elements.</p>\n		 		\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>- Listening to children’s feelings. Anxiety, anger and depression \n		 						are daily companions for dyslexics. However, their language problems \n		 						often make it difficult for them to express their feelings. Therefore, \n		 						adults must help them learn to talk about their feelings.</li>\n		 						<li>- Teachers and parents must reward effort, not just “the product”. \n		 						For the dyslexic, grades should be less important than progress.</li>\n		 						<li>- When confronting unacceptable behaviour, adults must not \n		 						inadvertently discourage the dyslexic child. Words such as “lazy” \n		 						or “incorrigible” can seriously damage the child’s self-image.</li>\n		 						<li>- Help students set realistic goals for themselves. Most dyslexic \n		 						students set unattainable goals. By helping the child set an attainable \n		 						goal, teachers can change the cycle of failure.</li>\n		 						<li>- Even more important, the child needs to recognize and rejoice in \n		 						his or her successes. To do so, he or she needs to achieve success in \n		 						some area of life. In some cases, the dyslexic’s strengths are obvious, \n		 						and many dyslexics’ self-esteem has been salvaged by prowess in athletics, \n		 						art, or mechanics. However, the dyslexic’s strengths are often more subtle \n		 						and less obvious. Parents and teachers need to find ways to relate the \n		 						child’s interests to the demands of real life.</li>\n		 						<li>- Finally, many successful dyslexic adults deal with their own pain \n		 						by reaching out to others. They may do volunteer work for charities or \n		 						churches, or choose vocations that require empathy and a social conscience. \n		 						These experiences help dyslexics feel more positive about themselves and deal \n		 						more effectively with their pain and frustration. Many opportunities exist \n		 						in our schools, homes and churches for dyslexics to help others. One important \n		 						area is peer tutoring. If dyslexic students do well in math or science, \n		 						they can be asked to tutor a classmate who is struggling. Perhaps that student \n		 						can reciprocate as a reader for the dyslexic student. Tutoring younger children, \n		 						especially other dyslexics, can be a positive experience for everyone involved.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 		\n		 					<p>Helping dyslexics feel better about themselves and deal effectively with \n		 					their feelings is a complex task. First, caring adults must understand the \n		 					cognitive and affective problems caused by Dyslexia. Then they must design \n		 					strategies that will help the dyslexic, like every other child, to find joy \n		 					and success in academics and personal relationships.</p>\n		 					<p>Thank you to the International Dyslexia Association</p>\n		 		\n		 				</div>\n		 		</div>\n		 	</div><!-- learning-dyslexia -->\n	<!-- Dyslexia -->\n		 	<div class="five Dyspraxia" data-shown="0">\n				<p>Dyspraxia<i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></p>\n			</div>\n			<div class="learning-five">\n		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n		 			<span>What is Dyspraxia?</span>\n		 			<div class="empty"></div>\n		 			<div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n		 				<div class="accordion">\n		 					<p>`Developmental Dyspraxia (also known as Developmental \n		 						Coordination Disorder and the Clumsy Child Syndrome)\n		 						is a neurologically based disorder of motor function, \n		 						affecting the gaining of new skills and the carrying \n		 						out of those already learned.’</p>\n		 					<p>It affects children in different ways at different \n		 						stages of development, and is inconsistent – as if \n		 						sometimes information is `put away’ in the wrong \n		 						drawer.</p>\n		 					<p>It is not a behaviour problem, not an overt physical \n		 						disability, and may not even be visible – until the \n		 						child tries to learn a new skill, or to repeat a \n		 						learned one out of context.

It often runs in families. Research shows that people with dyslexia process things differently, that there are neurological differences.</p>\n				<p>Simply put, we are all different, and people with dyslexia have brains that are wired slightly differently from most people.</p>\n				<p>Whatever the actual cause or causes, most people with dyslexia have some problems identifying the separate speech sounds within a word, and learning how letters represent those sounds.

Spelling, reading, writing, identifying direction (e.g. left and right mix ups), telling the time, following multiple instructions, and reading comprehension problems may all be present.</p>\n				<p>Since a large part of dyslexia is about processing difficulties (that is – mentally ordering specific inputs from the world around or the classroom), a child can be very good in some areas but may struggle in others.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>At what age does dyslexia become a problem?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Those with dyslexia are usually born with it, but it is often when they begin to learn using words and other symbols (letters, numbers) that the SLD becomes noticeable.</p>	\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>What level of intelligence does it affect?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Dyslexia occurs in children and adults of all levels of ability.
