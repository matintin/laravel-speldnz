		<h3>Learning Disabilities</h3>
		<p>Specific Learning Disabilities [SLD] is a general
		 term used in New Zealand to describe a range of learning 
		 difficulties experienced by people with average or above 
		 average overall intelligence. The term ‘dyslexia’ is most 
		 commonly used in the United Kingdom [UK], and the terms 
		 ‘Learning Disability’ [LD] and Reading Disability [RD] in 
		 the United States of America [USA]. Other frequently used 
		 terms include phonologically based reading disabilities [PRD],
		  and ‘specific learning difficulties’ (historically used in 
		  Australia).</p>

		<h3>Our work</h3>
		<p>Children with Specific Learning Disabilities means those 
		children who have a disorder in one or more of the basic 
		psychological processes involved in understanding or in using
		 language, spoken or written, which disorder may manifest itself 
		 in imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, 
		 spell or do mathematical calculations. Such disorders include
		  such conditions as perceptual difficulties, brain injury, 
		  minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.</p>
