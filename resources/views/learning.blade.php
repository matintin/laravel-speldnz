		<h3>Learning Disabilities</h3>
		<p>Specific Learning Disabilities [SLD] is a general
		 term used in New Zealand to describe a range of learning 
		 difficulties experienced by people with average or above 
		 average overall intelligence. The term ‘dyslexia’ is most 
		 commonly used in the United Kingdom [UK], and the terms 
		 ‘Learning Disability’ [LD] and Reading Disability [RD] in 
		 the United States of America [USA]. Other frequently used 
		 terms include phonologically based reading disabilities [PRD],
		  and ‘specific learning difficulties’ (historically used in 
		  Australia).</p>

		<h3>Our work</h3>
		<p>Children with Specific Learning Disabilities means those 
		children who have a disorder in one or more of the basic 
		psychological processes involved in understanding or in using
		 language, spoken or written, which disorder may manifest itself 
		 in imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, 
		 spell or do mathematical calculations. Such disorders include
		  such conditions as perceptual difficulties, brain injury, 
		  minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.</p>	
		
		<span>Effect<!-- Specific Learning Disabilities can be attributed to: --></span>
		<ul class="accodion">
			<li>Faulty brain structures i.e., damage to an area or the
			 interconnections between these.</li>
			<li>A lack of sensory stimulation leading to a lack of the 
				development in corresponding inter-connections, i.e. 
				phonological awareness deficits.</li>
			<li>Minor physical faults i.e. squints, high frequency 
				hearing loss, leading to imperfect information and 
				faulty processing.</li>
		</ul>

		<span>Factors<!-- that may combine to make learning difficult
		 for so many children may include the following: --></span>
		 <ul class="accodion">
		 	<li><span>Biochemical factors </span>Dr B Feingold 
		 		investigated the chemical structure of food and its 
		 		effect on the human body. He believes that the 
		 		consumption of food additives, such as artificial food 
		 		colouring and flavouring, and a child’s sensitivity to 
		 		sugar, help to contribute to hyperactivity attention 
		 		deficit which can cause Specific Learning Disabilities.</li>
		 	
		 	<li><span>Neurological irregularities </span>According to
		 	 some researchers Specific Learning Disabilities can be a 
		 	 result of incomplete or interrupted neurological 
		 	 organisation in the child’s nervous system. Since the 
		 	 child’s neurological organisation is not complete, 
		 	 difficulties in learning occur.</li>
		 </ul>

		 <span>NOT caused</span>
		 	<ul class="accodion">
		 		<li>Intellectual disability</li>
		 		<li>Deficit in the sense organs - Children with
		 		 SLD are not usually visually or auditory impaired. 
		 		 They may need glasses or use a hearing aid but their
		 		  difficulties in learning are not primarily caused by
		 		   these physical defects.</li>
		 		<li>Environmental and emotional deprivation - A child 
	 			living with substance, emotional and/or sexual abuse
	 			 may be considered environmentally deprived, but is
	 			  not necessarily a child with a Specific Learning 
	 			  Disability.</li>
		 		<li>Cultural or economic deprivation - A child living 
	 			in an environment with few stimuli such as books, 
	 			music or human contact may show some signs of having
	 			 learning difficulties, but will usually respond well
	 			 to learning opportunities following a change of
	 			  environment.</li>
		 		<li>Other disabilities -The similarities and differences
		 		 of children with aphasia, intellectual handicap, autism
		 		  deafness, cerebral palsy and Specific Learning Disabilities
		 		   is complex and must rest on a total overall view.</li>
		 	</ul>
