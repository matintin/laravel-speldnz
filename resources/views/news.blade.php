			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>In 2010 the New Zealand Council for Educational Research did 
					research to find out. Their evaluation shows SPELD NZ teachers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>- BUILD good relationships - they understand and respect students</li>
					<li>- CAPTURE students' interest and motivation by using a strength-based approach</li>
					<li>- BOOST students' self-esteem and confidence</li>
					<li>- ENGAGE students with learning</li>

			<h3>Here’s what parents say about the changes in their children:</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>My son had a lot of trouble at primary, intermediate and college with 
					his spelling, handwriting and telling the time. We tried many things 
					and nothing helped him until we started with SPELD. The assessment 
					showed he was dyslexic and dysgraphic and he started straight away 
					with a teacher, once a week for one hour. He turned into a happy, 
					achieving student within a month and is now finishing a Bachelor of 
					Science at Auckland University. SPELD was a fantastic help to our 
					family and I recommend it to adults and children – they really are 
					the experts in this field. <span>Kathie E</span></p>

				<p>Before my daughter started with SPELD tutoring, she was 
					highly anxious about school work, hated reading and could 
					not retain spelling words or multiplication and division 
					equations. She has been tutored for one and a half years, 
					during school terms. Among many of my daughter’s 
					achievements are such things as liking reading chapter 
					books, accurately recalling maths equations, and her 
					teacher has been impressed with her improvement of 
					spelling and writing. My daughter is noticeably more 
					relaxed about school which she admits is due to her 
					SPELD tutoring. <span>Hay M</span></p>

				<p>My son was struggling at school despite interventions 
					that had been put in place such as Reading Recovery 
					and Rainbow Reading. He didn't want to go to school 
					and his self-esteem was at an all-time low. A friend 
					of mine suggested we approach SPELD. We had him 
					assessed and discovered he was dyslexic. It was such 
					a relief to finally have some concrete evidence and 
					know what we were dealing with. They referred us to 
					a SPELD teacher who worked with him for two and half 
					years. She was amazing and gave him the skills and 
					self-belief to not only survive at school but to 
					thrive. He is a different child now. Gone are the 
					days when he would refuse to come out from beneath 
					the bed covers in the mornings! He is now a motivated, 
					hard-working Year 9 student whose latest exam results 
					blew us away. I credit SPELD with saving my son and 
					although he no longer needs a tutor I know that should 
					any problems arise they are only a phone call away. I 
					highly endorse SPELD - it is a fantastic investment in 
					your child’s future. <span>Jenny W</span></p>

				<p>His tutor has huge warmth and a great connection with 
					him. It’s really important kids want to learn and he 
					responds to her which is huge. She takes the panic 
					away for him and very calmly says “here’s a way you 
					can do that”. She’s able to push him to the limit of 
					where he can go. <span>Darren N</span></p>

			<h3>Here’s what one of our adult students says about SPELD NZ:</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>I went around all the outfits that help with spelling 
					and chose SPELD because they do their research. 
					They’re aware of upcoming education and they’re aware 
					that dyslexia is a brain function issue, not a 
					psychological thing. They know that we think and 
					function differently to 90 percent of the population. 
					My tutor was absolutely lovely. She would go along with 
					what I found easiest and was flexible enough to work the 
					magic with that. We all learn in different ways. Being 
					client centred is really important.</p>
				<p>I had carefully tailored my life to avoid situations where 
					I had to demonstrate reading and writing. I couldn’t even 
					fill in a boarding pass. I just couldn’t understand what 
					things meant. Now I’m so much more confident. My horizons 
					are much broader. It’s a wonderful, rewarding and enriching 
					thing to be able to communicate with written word, particularly
					in our world of computerisation.<span>Russell C</span></p>

			<h3>Pilot Research Project shows "vast improvements" for SPELD 
				NZ students</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>In 2011 SPELD NZ carried out a Pilot Programme in collaboration with 
					RTLBs. The data obtained from this Pilot Project was analysed by Dr 
					Karen Waldie of Auckland University. Dr Waldie said she didn't realise 
					just how successful the Pilot Project would be: "Not only are children 
					increasing their predicted reading success by 20-44% in areas of sound 
					blending, phonemic awareness, verbal comprehension and reading fluency, 
					but their general cognitive abilities also significantly improved. 
					We saw vast improvements in thinking ability, cognitive fluency and 
					processing speed."</p>
				<p>In July 2014, the New Zealand Journal of Educational Studies published 
					an article about this study. The article concludes that SPELD NZ 
					teaching was effective in improving the academic skills of children 
					with reading disabilities and also significantly increased overall 
					intellectual ability.</p>

			<h3>"Does SPELD Intervention work?" </h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>In 2009 the SPELD NZ Board commissioned the New Zealand Council for Educational Research to document the effectiveness of SPELD teaching methods by surveying classroom teachers, RTLB, parents, SPELD teachers and Assessors. Parts 1 & 2 of the Effectiveness Review were published in 2010. Previous Board President Rodney Barber realised that although the Board knew SPELD teachers were highly trained to assist children and adults with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) including dyslexia, what was still needed was statistical proof. So he set out to prove it.</p>
				<p>With the support of the RTLB Association, The Principals’ Federation, SPELD teachers and assessors around New Zealand, our group of 42 students were selected and assessed. Teaching began in Term 1, 2011. The children were from different schools and circumstances; from decile one (fully funded by SPELD financial assistance) to decile ten (with full payment from parents). Reassessments were completed after 60 lessons and the data has been assessed by Dr Karen Waldie, Associate Professor, School of Psychology, Auckland University.</p>
				<p>This is what Dr Waldie has to say.</p>
				<i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
				<p>I agreed to analyse the SPELD NZ pilot data back in 2010 because I believe in SPELD and know that children with dyslexia do better with this than any other remediation programme I'm aware of.  I knew that I would find that students would increase their reading skills after SPELD lessons. What I didn't realize, however, was just how successful the pilot programme would be. Not only are children increasing their predicted reading success by 20-44% in areas of sound blending, phonemic awareness, verbal comprehension and reading fluency, but their general cognitive abilities also significantly improved. We saw vast improvements in thinking ability, cognitive fluency and processing speed. I am truly impressed!</p>
				<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
				<p>SPELD NZ thanks Dr Waldie for her detailed analysis of our results.  See Page 4 of this newsletter for a summary written by Dunedin Psychologist and SPELD Board member Jack Austin.</p>
				<p>Professor John Hattie from Melbourne Education Research Institute has kindly agreed to add his interpretation of the data and this will be available soon.  The full results will be published in an academic journal and on the SPELD website in due course.</p>
				<p>The pilot project has proven that by investing in our underachieving seven year old children, we can help them to achieve literacy and success at school. As SLD can be hereditary, this would have a flow on intergenerational benefit. </p>
				<p>Can we afford NOT to help these children?</p>

			<h3>"Success for SPELD NZ"</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>Pilot Research Program: looking at ourselves</p>
				<p>At the 2012 SPELD NZ Conference in Palmerston North we received some excellent news.  Dr Karen Waldie, a noted researcher, spoke about the results of the SPELD NZ Pilot Project(1).  Dr Waldie is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and Research Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Auckland.</p>
				<p>Having a well-regarded and independent academic analyse the results of the Pilot Project gives those results real credibility.  SPELD NZ professionals have the goal of making a difference for those with dyslexia.  These results indicate that the work and approach of SPELD NZ is at the very least heading in the right direction.</p>
				<p>In the course of her Conference presentation Dr Waldie commented that she had been impressed by the degree of difference that the research results highlighted. </p>
				<p>The Pilot Project had a sample size of 42 seven year old students. These students received a ‘before’ assessment using the Woodcock-Johnson III (WJIII) test battery, then 60forty-five minute sessions of 1:1 tuition, twice weekly. This remedial intervention was followed by another assessment using the same WJIII test battery.</p>
				<p>Although the sample size of 42 is not large, the analysis of the findings from the SPELD NZ Pilot Project is very encouraging indeed.  Ideally a similar project will be repeated in the future so as to demonstrate even more strongly the positive outcomes of SPELD NZ work.  It is hoped that these results can be used to support applications for funding for further research.</p>
				<p>At that time a similar key question would be asked, i.e. “Do students who are given SPELD tuition, perform significantly better at the second assessment, than they did at their first, for each Cognitive and Achievement test?” </p>
				<p>As noted above, when that question was asked in this Pilot Project, the results were very pleasing for all concerned.</p>
				<p>Dr Waldie carried out detailed statistical analyses on each test or cluster and on each dependent variable to show the effectiveness of SPELD NZ teaching. (A more detailed and academic report than is given here, will be available soon on the SPELD NZ website).</p>
				<p>In a summary form some of the main findings reported on included:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>- All cognitive abilities improved significantly</li>
					<li>- There were small but useful increases for students in verbal ability, phonemic awareness, cognitive efficiency and processing speed.</li>
					<li>- There was an improvement in general intellectual ability.</li>
					<li>- There was a significant improvement in thinking ability.  Thinking ability covers visual-auditory learning, spatial relations, sound blending, concept formation, retrieval fluency, picture recognition, auditory attention and Analysis-Synthesis.  This is a particularly useful area in which to be able to demonstrate student gains.</li>
					<li>- Visual matching, number reversal, decision speed and memory for words aspects of cognitive efficiency did not show significant improvement.</li>
					<li>- Student phonemic awareness showed significant development.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Dr Waldie also carried out statistical analysis on the Success Rate Achievement results. </p>
				<p>All achievement skills improvedsignificantly.</p>
				<p>Broad reading skills, word identification and sounding out skills showed the most change.  Oral language, listening and spelling skills also showed development but not to the same degree. Overall, word attack scores improved significantly.</p>
				<p>That statistical analysis shows such satisfactory results for SPELD NZ intervention also has wider implications for students. Success leads to confidence and this is exemplified by many of the comments received at the end of the Pilot research programme.  Typical (unedited) comments included:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>- “I feel better on the inside now.”</li>
					<li>- “will happily write now”</li>
					<li>- “massive improvements in behaviour and attitude”</li>
					<li>- “Confidence has improved”.</li>
					<li>- “He feels much happier to attempt to read words for himself”.</li>
					<li>- “He feels proud when he achieves things for himself.”</li>
				</ul>

				<p>SPELD NZ has something to be proud of with the results of this research.  Although it is a first step, it indicates that the SPELD NZ approach is built on strong foundations and can make a strong contribution to those with dyslexia and to the wider education sector.</p>
				<p>These research results will be publicized and used to develop and underpin future work.  The time, energy and thought put into this project has resulted in SPELD NZ being able to look forward with confidence, just as those students involved in this piece of research can. </p>

			<span>SPELD NZ Documentary on YouTube</span>
			<p>In May 2012, a documentary about SPELD NZ featured on TV3 in the Open Door series.   Children, parents, teachers, SPELD NZ teachers and staff were interviewed about the journey families take when they join SPELD NZ and start to get appropriate help for their family. This documentary also followed up on the progress of some of the participants from the earlier documentary about SPELD NZ filmed some 10 years ago.</p>
