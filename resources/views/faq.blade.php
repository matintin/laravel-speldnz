			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>No definition is perfect or all-inclusive.</p>
				<p>Simply put, dyslexia is a specific learning disability (‘SLD’) that makes it far harder to learn to read, write or do number work. It is a processing difficulty that makes achieving success in literacy and numeracy (reading, writing, spelling, and maths for example) a real challenge.</p>
				<p>Dyslexia continues through life, but can be assessed and then its effects can be diminished by specialist strategies and techniques.</p>

			<h3>What causes dyslexia?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>The exact causes of dyslexia are still not completely clear. It often runs in families. Research shows that people with dyslexia process things differently, that there are neurological differences.</p>
				<p>Simply put, we are all different, and people with dyslexia have brains that are wired slightly differently from most people.</p>
				<p>Whatever the actual cause or causes, most people with dyslexia have some problems identifying the separate speech sounds within a word, and learning how letters represent those sounds. Thus, reading, spelling, writing, and maths can become a challenge to varying degrees.</p>

			<h3>What are some things to remember?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<ul>
					<li>- Not all people with dyslexia have the same specific learning difficulties, or level of difficulties.</li>
					<li>- Dyslexia has little to do with intelligence, talents, or motivation.</li>
					<li>- With specialist assessment and teaching, dyslexics can learn successfully. But we are all different, in dyslexia, in life and in personality. Everyone learns at different rates and in their own style.</li>

			<h3>What are some common symptoms of dyslexia?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>Those with dyslexia generally have difficulty with a variety of things. Spelling, reading, writing, identifying direction (e.g. left and right mix ups), telling the time, following multiple instructions, and reading comprehension problems may all be present.</p>
				<p>Since a large part of dyslexia is about processing difficulties (that is – mentally ordering specific inputs from the world around or the classroom), a child can be very good in some areas but may struggle in others.</p>

			<h3>At what age does dyslexia become a problem?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>Those with dyslexia are usually born with it, but it is often when they begin to learn using words and other symbols (letters, numbers) that the SLD becomes noticeable.</p>

			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>Dyslexia occurs in children and adults of all levels of ability. These individuals are often capable or even gifted in areas that do not require strong language skills. Early assessment and support can help with self-esteem and learning.</p>

			<h3>Can dyslexia be cured?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>The difficulties any dyslexic person has can vary from slight to severe interference with the learning process. While there is no total cure, the effects can be reduced by specialist teaching methods.</p>	
				<p>There is no medication for people with dyslexia, and it is not an illness.</p>
				<p>Specialist help may not be able to cure dyslexia, but research based help and teaching can lessen its effects markedly.</p>

			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>Failure, lack of success, or learning difficulties can lower self-esteem in anyone.</p>
				<p>As literacy and numeracy work is a big part of schooling, early assessment and support is a key to feeling good about oneself. Making sure that praise is given for success in other learning areas (arts, crafts, sport, and stories, for example) is also very important.</p>

			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>Education is language based, so reading, writing, spelling, and maths are at risk. For older children, learning foreign languages can be a challenge. Working with the school to ensure a flexible approach to learning after recognising dyslexia or SLD, is a positive step towards success.</p>

				<p>That really depends on the type of career, and the achievements of the person. Having received proper intervention and learning support, many people with dyslexia are very successful in their work and careers.</p>

				<p>Parents have the major role in any child’s life. For instance they can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Build self-esteem, praise success.</li>
					<li>Encourage interests, talents, and do activities together.</li>

			<h3>Is it true that ‘dyslexia’ is just another word for ‘slow’ or ‘not trying hard enough’?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="accordion-news">
				<p>No, this isn’t true at all. People with dyslexia are often very able and highly motivated to work hard. A learning difficulty just means they have to learn differently, and many people with dyslexia are very creative and successful in their lives.</p>

				<p>Learn about dyslexia; become your child’s advocate; learn how they learn and adapt the world for them. Simple things like forming the spelling words with a ball of wool on the floor, or making the words out of blue tack or play-dough – the more multi- sensory the learning, the easier it will be to entrench the information in the long term memory.</p>
