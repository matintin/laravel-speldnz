		 			<p>Dyslexia is a phonological-based learning 
		 			disability. Dyslexia affects individuals throughout 
		 			their lives; however, its impact can change at 
		 			different stages in a person’s life. It is referred 
		 			to as a learning disability because Dyslexia can make
		 			it very difficult for a student to succeed academically
		 			in the typical instructional environment, and in its 
		 			more severe forms, will qualify a student for special
	 		   	    education, special accommodations, or extra support
	 			    services.</p>

		 		<div class="accordion">
		 			<p>The exact causes of Dyslexia are still not 
		 			completely clear, but anatomical and brain imagery
		 			studies show differences in the way the brain of
		 			a dyslexic person develops and functions. Moreover, 
		 			most people with Dyslexia have been found to have 
		 			problems with identifying the separate speech sounds
		 			within a word and/or learning how letters represent
		 			those sounds, a key factor in their reading 
		 			difficulties. Dyslexia is not due to either lack 
		 			of intelligence or desire to learn; with appropriate 
		 			teaching methods, dyslexics can learn successfully.</p>

		 	<span>How widespread is Dyslexia?</span>
		 	<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 		<div class="accordion">
		 			<p>About 7% of students in New Zealand Schools have 
		 			Dyslexia. Not all of these will qualify for special 
		 			education, but they are likely to struggle with many 
		 			aspects of academic learning and are likely to benefit
		 			 from systematic, explicit, instruction in reading, 
		 			 writing, and language.</p>

					<P>Dyslexia occurs in people of all backgrounds and 
					intellectual levels. People who are very bright can be
					 dyslexic. They are often capable or even gifted in 
					 areas that do not require strong language skills, 
					 such as art, computer science, design, drama, 
					 electronics, math, mechanics, music, physics, sales,
					  and sports.</P>

					<P>In addition, Dyslexia runs in families; dyslexic 
					parents are very likely to have children who are
					 dyslexic. Some people are identified as dyslexic early
					  in their lives, but for others, their Dyslexia goes
					   unidentified until they get older.</p>

		 	<span>What are the effects of Dyslexia?</span>
		 	<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 		<div class="accordion">
		 			<p>The impact that Dyslexia has is different for 
		 			each person and depends on the severity of the 
		 			condition and the effectiveness of instruction or 
		 			remediation. The core difficulty is with word 
		 			recognition and reading fluency, spelling, and 
		 			writing. Some dyslexics manage to learn early 
		 			reading and spelling tasks, especially with 
		 			excellent instruction, but later experience their
		 			most debilitating problems when more complex 
		 			language skills are required, such as grammar, 
		 			understanding textbook material, and writing essays.
		 			People with Dyslexia can also have problems with 
		 			spoken language, even after they have been exposed
		 			to good language models in their homes and good
		 			language instruction in school. They may find
		 			it difficult to express themselves clearly, or
		 			to fully comprehend what others mean when they
		 			speak. Such language problems are often 
		 			difficult to recognize, but they can lead
		 			to major problems in school, in the workplace,
		 			and in relating to other people. The effects of 
		 			Dyslexia reach well beyond the classroom. Dyslexia 
		 			can also affect a person’s self-image. Students with
		 			Dyslexia often end up feeling “dumb” and less capable
		 			than they actually are. After experiencing a great
		 			deal of stress due to academic problems, a student
		 			may become discouraged about continuing in school.</p>

		 	<span>What are the signs of Dyslexia?</span>
		 	<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 		<div class="accordion">
		 			<p>The problems displayed by individuals with 
		 			Dyslexia involve difficulties in acquiring and
		 			using written language. It is a myth that dyslexic
		 			individuals “read backwards,” although spelling
		 			can look quite jumbled at times because students
		 			have trouble remembering letter symbols for 
		 			sounds and forming memories for words. Other 
		 			problems experienced by dyslexics include the 
		 			following:</p>

					<ul>	
						<li>- Learning to speak</li>
						<li>- Learning letters and their sounds</li>
						<li>- Organizing written and spoken language</li>
						<li>- Memorizing number facts</li>
						<li>- Reading quickly enough to comprehend</li>
						<li>- Persisting with and comprehending longer reading assignments</li>
						<li>- Spelling</li>
						<li>- Learning a foreign language</li>
						<li>- Correctly doing math operations</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Not all students who have difficulties with 
					these skills are dyslexic. Formal testing of reading,
					language, and writing skills is the only way to confirm
					a diagnosis of suspected Dyslexia.</p>

		 	<span>How is Dyslexia diagnosed?</span>
		 	<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 		<div class="accordion">
		 			<p>If a student’s learning does not accelerate 
		 			enough with supplemental instruction to reach the
		 			established grade-level benchmarks, and other 
		 			kinds of developmental disorders are ruled out,
		 			he or she may be identified as having a specific
		 			learning disability in reading. The majority of 
		 			students thus identified are likely dyslexic.
		 			Schools are encouraged to begin screening 
		 			children in kindergarten to identify any 
		 			child who exhibits the early signs of potential
		 			reading difficulties.</p>

					<p>For children and adults who are not formally 
					identified through the schooling assessments, an 
					assessment to formally diagnose Dyslexia is needed.
					Such an assessment traditionally has included 
					intellectual and academic achievement testing, 
					as well as an assessment of the critical underlying
					language skills that are closely linked to Dyslexia.
					These include receptive (listening) and expressive
					language skills, phonological skills including to
					phonemic awareness, and also a student’s ability 
					rapidly name letters and names. A student’s ability
					to read lists of words in isolation, as well as 
					words in context, should also be assessed. If a 
					profile emerges that is characteristic of dyslexic 
					readers, an individualised intervention plan should 
					be developed. Speld nz has a large number of specialist
					trained Assessors and they can be contacted by ringing 
					0800 speldnz.</p>
