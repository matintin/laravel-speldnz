		 					<p>Dyslexia is a phonological-based learning 
		 					disability. Dyslexia affects individuals throughout 
		 					their lives; however, its impact can change at 
		 					different stages in a person’s life. It is referred 
		 					to as a learning disability because Dyslexia can make
		 					it very difficult for a student to succeed academically
		 					in the typical instructional environment, and in its 
		 					more severe forms, will qualify a student for special

		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>The exact causes of Dyslexia are still not 
		 					completely clear, but anatomical and brain imagery
		 					studies show differences in the way the brain of
		 					a dyslexic person develops and functions. Moreover, 
		 					most people with Dyslexia have been found to have 
		 					problems with identifying the separate speech sounds
		 					within a word and/or learning how letters represent
		 					those sounds, a key factor in their reading 
		 					difficulties. Dyslexia is not due to either lack 
		 					of intelligence or desire to learn; with appropriate 
		 					teaching methods, dyslexics can learn successfully.</p>

		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">
		 			<span>How widespread is Dyslexia?</span>
		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>About 7% of students in New Zealand Schools have 
		 					Dyslexia. Not all of these will qualify for special 
		 					education, but they are likely to struggle with many 
		 					aspects of academic learning and are likely to benefit
		 					 from systematic, explicit, instruction in reading, 
		 					 writing, and language.</p>
		 		
		 							<P>Dyslexia occurs in people of all backgrounds and 
		 							intellectual levels. People who are very bright can be
		 							 dyslexic. They are often capable or even gifted in 
		 							 areas that do not require strong language skills, 
		 							 such as art, computer science, design, drama, 
		 							 electronics, math, mechanics, music, physics, sales,
		 							  and sports.</P>
		 		
		 							<P>In addition, Dyslexia runs in families; dyslexic 
		 							parents are very likely to have children who are
		 							 dyslexic. Some people are identified as dyslexic early
		 							  in their lives, but for others, their Dyslexia goes
		 							   unidentified until they get older.</p>

		 			<span>What are the effects of Dyslexia?</span>
		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>The impact that Dyslexia has is different for 
		 					each person and depends on the severity of the 
		 					condition and the effectiveness of instruction or 
		 					remediation. The core difficulty is with word 
		 					recognition and reading fluency, spelling, and 
		 					writing. Some dyslexics manage to learn early 
		 					reading and spelling tasks, especially with 
		 					excellent instruction, but later experience their
		 					most debilitating problems when more complex 
		 					language skills are required, such as grammar, 
		 					understanding textbook material, and writing essays.
		 					People with Dyslexia can also have problems with 
		 					spoken language, even after they have been exposed
		 					to good language models in their homes and good
		 					language instruction in school. They may find
		 					it difficult to express themselves clearly, or
		 					to fully comprehend what others mean when they
		 					speak. Such language problems are often 
		 					difficult to recognize, but they can lead
		 					to major problems in school, in the workplace,
		 					and in relating to other people. The effects of 
		 					Dyslexia reach well beyond the classroom. Dyslexia 
		 					can also affect a person’s self-image. Students with
		 					Dyslexia often end up feeling “dumb” and less capable
		 					than they actually are. After experiencing a great
		 					deal of stress due to academic problems, a student
		 					may become discouraged about continuing in school.</p>

		 			<span>What are the signs of Dyslexia?</span>
		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>The problems displayed by individuals with 
		 					Dyslexia involve difficulties in acquiring and
		 					using written language. It is a myth that dyslexic
		 					individuals “read backwards,” although spelling
		 					can look quite jumbled at times because students
		 					have trouble remembering letter symbols for 
		 					sounds and forming memories for words. Other 
		 					problems experienced by dyslexics include the 
		 					following:</p>
		 		
		 							<ul>	
		 								<li>- Learning to speak</li>
		 								<li>- Learning letters and their sounds</li>
		 								<li>- Organizing written and spoken language</li>
		 								<li>- Memorizing number facts</li>
		 								<li>- Reading quickly enough to comprehend</li>
		 								<li>- Persisting with and comprehending longer reading assignments</li>
		 								<li>- Spelling</li>
		 								<li>- Learning a foreign language</li>
		 								<li>- Correctly doing math operations</li>
		 							</ul>
		 		
		 							<p>Not all students who have difficulties with 
		 							these skills are dyslexic. Formal testing of reading,
		 							language, and writing skills is the only way to confirm
		 							a diagnosis of suspected Dyslexia.</p>

		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>If a student’s learning does not accelerate 
		 					enough with supplemental instruction to reach the
		 					established grade-level benchmarks, and other 
		 					kinds of developmental disorders are ruled out,
		 					he or she may be identified as having a specific
		 					learning disability in reading. The majority of 
		 					students thus identified are likely dyslexic.
		 					Schools are encouraged to begin screening 
		 					children in kindergarten to identify any 
		 					child who exhibits the early signs of potential
		 					reading difficulties.</p>
		 		
		 							<p>For children and adults who are not formally 
		 							identified through the schooling assessments, an 
		 							assessment to formally diagnose Dyslexia is needed.
		 							Such an assessment traditionally has included 
		 							intellectual and academic achievement testing, 
		 							as well as an assessment of the critical underlying
		 							language skills that are closely linked to Dyslexia.
		 							These include receptive (listening) and expressive
		 							language skills, phonological skills including to
		 							phonemic awareness, and also a student’s ability 
		 							rapidly name letters and names. A student’s ability
		 							to read lists of words in isolation, as well as 
		 							words in context, should also be assessed. If a

		 			<span>How is Dyslexia treated?</span>
		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>Dyslexia is a life-long condition. With proper 
		 					help, many people with Dyslexia can learn to read 
		 					and write well. Early identification and treatment
		 					is the key to helping dyslexics achieve in school
		 					and in life. Most people with Dyslexia need help
		 					from a teacher specially trained in using a 
		 					multi-sensory, structured language approach. It is
		 					important for these individuals to be taught by a
		 					systematic and explicit method that involves several
		 					senses (hearing, seeing, touching) at the same time. 
		 					Many individuals with Dyslexia need one-on-one help so
		 					that they can move forward at their own pace. In addition,
		 					students with Dyslexia often need a great deal of structured
		 					practice and immediate, corrective feedback to develop 
		 					automatic word-recognition skills. When students with Dyslexia
		 					receive academic tuition outside of school, the teacher should
		 					work closely with classroom teachers, special education 
		 					providers, and other school personnel. Speld nz has over 300
		 					teachers that have also completed specialist training in 
		 					Dyslexia and other specific learning disabilities. For further

		 			<span>Do Emotional Disorders cause Dyslexia?</span>
		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>Research indicates that Dyslexia is caused by 
		 					biological factors not emotional or family problems.
		 					Samuel T. Orton, M.D. was one of the first researchers
		 					to describe the emotional aspects of Dyslexia. According
		 					to his research, the majority of dyslexic preschoolers 
		 					are happy and well adjusted. Their emotional problems 
		 					begin to develop when early reading instruction does not 
		 					match their learning style. Over the years, the frustration 
		 					mounts as classmates surpass the dyslexic student in reading 
		 					skills. Recent research funded by the National Institute of 
		 					Health has identified many of the neurological and cognitive 
		 					differences that contribute to Dyslexia. The vast majority of 
		 					these factors appear to be caused by genetics rather than poor 
		 					parenting or childhood depression or anxiety.</p>

		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">
		 			<span>Why is Dyslexia discouraging and frustrating?</span>
		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>The frustration of children with Dyslexia often 
		 					centres on their inability to meet expectations. Their 
		 					parents and teachers see a bright, enthusiastic child who 
		 					is not learning to read and write. Time and again, dyslexics 
		 					and their parents hear, “He’s such a bright child; if only he 
		 					would try harder.” Ironically, no one knows exactly how hard 
		 					the dyslexic is trying.</p>
		 					<p>The pain of failing to meet other people’s 
		 					expectations is surpassed only by dyslexics’ 
		 					inability to achieve their goals. This is particularly 
		 					true of those who develop perfectionistic expectations 
		 					in order to deal with their anxiety. They grow up 
		 					believing that it is “terrible” to make a mistake. 
		 					However, their learning disability, almost by definition 
		 					means that these children will make many “careless” or 
		 					“stupid” mistakes. This is extremely frustrating to them, 
		 					as it makes them feel chronically inadequate.</p>
		 					<p>The dyslexic frequently has problems with social 
		 					relationships. These can be traced to the following causes:</p>
		 					<ul>
		 						<li>- Dyslexic children may be physically and socially 
		 						immature in comparison to their peers. This can lead to 
		 						a poor self-image and less peer acceptance.</li>
		 						<li>- Dyslexics’ social immaturity may make them awkward 
		 						in social situations.</li>
		 						<li>- Many dyslexics have difficulty reading social cues. 
		 						They may be oblivious to the amount of personal distance 
		 						necessary in social interactions or insensitive to other 
		 						people’s body language.</li>
		 						<li>- Dyslexia often affects oral language functioning. 
		 						Affected persons may have trouble finding the right words, 
		 						may stammer, or may pause before answering direct questions. 
		 						This puts them at a disadvantage as they enter adolescence, 
		 						when language becomes more central to their relationships 
		 						with peers.</li>
		 					</ul>
		 					
		 				</div>
		 		</div>
		 		
		 		<div class="accordion-wrap">
		 			<span>What does the dyslexic person feel?</span>
		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<li><span>Anxiety</span>Anxiety is the most frequent emotional
		 					 symptom reported by dyslexic adults. Dyslexics become fearful 
		 					 because of their constant frustration and confusion in school. 
		 					 These feelings are exacerbated by the inconsistencies of Dyslexia. 
		 					 Because they may anticipate failure, entering new situations can 
		 					 becomes extremely anxiety provoking. Anxiety causes human beings 
		 					 to avoid whatever frightens them. The dyslexic is no exception. 
		 					 However, many teachers and parents misinterpret this avoidance 
		 					 behaviour as laziness. In fact, the dyslexic’s hesitancy to 
		 					 participate in school activities such as homework is related 
		 					 more to anxiety and confusion than to apathy.</li>
		 					<li><span>Anger</span>Many of the emotional problems caused by 
		 					Dyslexia occur out of frustration with school or social situations. 
		 					Social scientists have frequently observed that frustration produces 
		 					anger. This can be clearly seen in many dyslexics. The obvious target 
		 					of the dyslexic’s anger would be schools and teachers. However, it is 
		 					also common for the dyslexic to vent his anger on his parents. Mothers 
		 					are particularly likely to feel the dyslexic’s wrath. Often, the child 
		 					sits on his anger during school to the point of being extremely passive. 
		 					However, once he is in the safe environment of home, these very powerful 
		 					feelings erupt and are often directed toward the mother. Ironically, it 
		 					is the child’s trust of the mother that allows him to vent his anger. 
		 					However, this becomes very frustrating and confusing to the parent who 
		 					is desperately trying to help their child. As youngsters reach 
		 					adolescence, society expects them to become independent. The tension 
		 					between the expectation of independence and the child’s learned 
		 					dependence causes great internal conflicts. The adolescent dyslexic 
		 					uses his anger to break away from those people on which he feels so 
		 					dependent. Because of these factors, it may be difficult for parents 
		 					to help their teenage dyslexic. Instead, peer tutoring or a concerned 
		 					young adult may be better able to intervene and help the child.</li>
		 					<li><span>Self Image</span>The dyslexic’s self-image appears to be 
		 					extremely vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. According to Erik 
		 					Erikson, during the first years of school, every child must resolve 
		 					the conflicts between a positive self-image and feelings of inferiority. 
		 					If children succeed in school, they will develop positive feelings about 
		 					themselves and believe that they can succeed in life. If children meet 
		 					failure and frustration, they learn that they are inferior to others, 
		 					and that their effort makes very little difference. Instead of feeling 
		 					powerful and productive, they learn that their environment controls them. 
		 					They feel powerless and incompetent. <br /><br />Researchers have learned 
		 					that when typical learners succeed, they credit their own efforts for their 
		 					success. When they fail, they tell themselves to try harder. However, when 
		 					the dyslexic succeeds, he is likely to attribute his success to luck. When 
		 					he fails, he simply sees himself as stupid.<br /><br />Research also suggests 
		 					that these feelings of inferiority develop by the age of ten. After this age, 
		 					it becomes extremely difficult to help the child develop a positive self-image. 
		 					This is a powerful argument for early intervention.</li>
		 					<li><span>Depression</span>Depression is also a frequent complication in 
		 					Dyslexia. Although most dyslexics are not depressed, children with this 
		 					kind of learning disability are at higher risk for intense feelings of 
		 					sorrow and pain. Perhaps because of their low self-esteem, dyslexics are 
		 					afraid to turn their anger toward their environment and instead turn it 
		 					toward themselves. However, depressed children and adolescents often have 
		 					different symptoms than do depressed adults. The depressed child is unlikely 
		 					to be lethargic or to talk about feeling sad. Instead he or she may become 
		 					more active or misbehave to cover up the painful feelings. In the case of 
		 					masked depression, the child may not seem obviously unhappy. However, both 
		 					children and adults who are depressed tend to have three similar characteristics:
		 					<br /><br />First, they tend to have negative thoughts about themselves, i.e. a 
		 					negative self-image. Second, they tend to view the world negatively. They are less 
		 					likely to enjoy the positive experiences in life. This makes it difficult for them 
		 					to have fun.<br /><br />Finally, most depressed youngsters have great trouble 
		 					imagining anything positive about the future. The depressed dyslexic not only 
		 					experiences great pain in his present experiences, but also foresees a life of 
		 					continuing failure.</li>
		 					<li><span>Family Problems</span>Like any handicapping condition, Dyslexia has 
		 					a tremendous impact on the child’s family. However, because Dyslexia is an 
		 					invisible handicap, these effects are often overlooked. Dyslexia affects the 
		 					family in a variety of ways. One of the most obvious is sibling rivalry. 
		 					Non-dyslexic children often feel jealous of the dyslexic child, who gets the 
		 					majority of the parents’ attention, time, and money. Ironically, the dyslexic 
		 					child does not want this attention. This increases the chances that he or she 
		 					will act negatively against the achieving children in the family.<br /><br />Specific 
		 					developmental Dyslexia runs in families. This means that one or both of the child’s 
		 					parents may have had similar school problems. When faced with a child who is having 
		 					school problems, dyslexic parents may react in one of two ways. They may deny the 
		 					existence of Dyslexia and believe if the child would just buckle down, he or she 
		 					could succeed. Or, the parents may relive their failures and frustrations through 
		 					their child’s school experience. This brings back powerful and terrifying emotions, 
		 					which can interfere with the adult’s parenting skills.</li>

		 				<div class="accordion-wrap">
		 			<span>How can parents and teachers help?</span>
		 			<div class="img-wrap"><img src="asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>
		 				<div class="accordion">
		 					<p>Both teachers and parents need to offer consistent, ongoing encouragement 
		 					and support. However, one rarely hears about this very important way to help 
		 					youngsters. Encouragement involves at least four elements.</p>
		 		
		 					<ul>
		 						<li>- Listening to children’s feelings. Anxiety, anger and depression 
		 						are daily companions for dyslexics. However, their language problems 
		 						often make it difficult for them to express their feelings. Therefore, 
		 						adults must help them learn to talk about their feelings.</li>
		 						<li>- Teachers and parents must reward effort, not just “the product”. 
		 						For the dyslexic, grades should be less important than progress.</li>
		 						<li>- When confronting unacceptable behaviour, adults must not 
		 						inadvertently discourage the dyslexic child. Words such as “lazy” 
		 						or “incorrigible” can seriously damage the child’s self-image.</li>
		 						<li>- Help students set realistic goals for themselves. Most dyslexic 
		 						students set unattainable goals. By helping the child set an attainable 
		 						goal, teachers can change the cycle of failure.</li>
		 						<li>- Even more important, the child needs to recognize and rejoice in 
		 						his or her successes. To do so, he or she needs to achieve success in 
		 						some area of life. In some cases, the dyslexic’s strengths are obvious, 
		 						and many dyslexics’ self-esteem has been salvaged by prowess in athletics, 
		 						art, or mechanics. However, the dyslexic’s strengths are often more subtle 
		 						and less obvious. Parents and teachers need to find ways to relate the 
		 						child’s interests to the demands of real life.</li>
		 						<li>- Finally, many successful dyslexic adults deal with their own pain 
		 						by reaching out to others. They may do volunteer work for charities or 
		 						churches, or choose vocations that require empathy and a social conscience. 
		 						These experiences help dyslexics feel more positive about themselves and deal 
		 						more effectively with their pain and frustration. Many opportunities exist 
		 						in our schools, homes and churches for dyslexics to help others. One important 
		 						area is peer tutoring. If dyslexic students do well in math or science, 
		 						they can be asked to tutor a classmate who is struggling. Perhaps that student 
		 						can reciprocate as a reader for the dyslexic student. Tutoring younger children, 
		 						especially other dyslexics, can be a positive experience for everyone involved.</li>
		 					</ul>
		 		
		 					<p>Helping dyslexics feel better about themselves and deal effectively with 
		 					their feelings is a complex task. First, caring adults must understand the 
		 					cognitive and affective problems caused by Dyslexia. Then they must design 
		 					strategies that will help the dyslexic, like every other child, to find joy 
		 					and success in academics and personal relationships.</p>
