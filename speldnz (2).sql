It is a processing difficulty that makes achieving success in literacy and numeracy (reading, writing, spelling, and maths for example) a real challenge.</p>\n				<p>Dyslexia continues through life, but can be assessed and then its effects can be diminished by specialist strategies and techniques.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>What causes dyslexia?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>The exact causes of dyslexia are still not completely clear. It often runs in families. Research shows that people with dyslexia process things differently, that there are neurological differences.</p>\n				<p>Simply put, we are all different, and people with dyslexia have brains that are wired slightly differently from most people.</p>\n				<p>Whatever the actual cause or causes, most people with dyslexia have some problems identifying the separate speech sounds within a word, and learning how letters represent those sounds. Thus, reading, spelling, writing, and maths can become a challenge to varying degrees.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>What are some things to remember?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<ul>\n					<li>Not all people with dyslexia have the same specific learning difficulties, or level of difficulties.</li>\n					<li>Dyslexia has little to do with intelligence, talents, or motivation.</li>\n					<li>With specialist assessment and teaching, dyslexics can learn successfully. But we are all different, in dyslexia, in life and in personality. Everyone learns at different rates and in their own style.</li>\n				</ul>	\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>What are some common symptoms of dyslexia?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Those with dyslexia generally have difficulty with a variety of things. Spelling, reading, writing, identifying direction (e.g. left and right mix ups), telling the time, following multiple instructions, and reading comprehension problems may all be present.</p>\n				<p>Since a large part of dyslexia is about processing difficulties (that is – mentally ordering specific inputs from the world around or the classroom), a child can be very good in some areas but may struggle in others.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>At what age does dyslexia become a problem?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Those with dyslexia are usually born with it, but it is often when they begin to learn using words and other symbols (letters, numbers) that the SLD becomes noticeable.</p>	\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>What level of intelligence does it affect?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Dyslexia occurs in children and adults of all levels of ability. These individuals are often capable or even gifted in areas that do not require strong language skills. Early assessment and support can help with self-esteem and learning.</p>	\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>Can dyslexia be cured?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>The difficulties any dyslexic person has can vary from slight to severe interference with the learning process. While there is no total cure, the effects can be reduced by specialist teaching methods.</p>	\n				<p>There is no medication for people with dyslexia, and it is not an illness.</p>\n				<p>Specialist help may not be able to cure dyslexia, but research based help and teaching can lessen its effects markedly.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>How many people are dyslexic?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Estimates vary, but possibility up to 10% of the population may have some degree of dyslexia.</p>	\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>Are boys more affected than girls?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>It appears that numbers are about equal.</p>	\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>Does dyslexia affect a child’s self-esteem?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Failure, lack of success, or learning difficulties can lower self-esteem in anyone.</p>\n				<p>As literacy and numeracy work is a big part of schooling, early assessment and support is a key to feeling good about oneself. Making sure that praise is given for success in other learning areas (arts, crafts, sport, and stories, for example) is also very important.</p>	\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>How does dyslexia affect other areas of schooling?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Education is language based, so reading, writing, spelling, and maths are at risk. For older children, learning foreign languages can be a challenge. Working with the school to ensure a flexible approach to learning after recognising dyslexia or SLD, is a positive step towards success.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>Does dyslexia limit career prospects?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>That really depends on the type of career, and the achievements of the person. Having received proper intervention and learning support, many people with dyslexia are very successful in their work and careers.</p>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>How can a parent help their child with dyslexia?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>Parents have the major role in any child’s life. For instance they can:</p>\n				<ul>\n					<li>Build self-esteem, praise success.</li>\n					<li>Encourage interests, talents, and do activities together.</li>\n					<li>Work with the school and class teacher.</li>\n					<li>Plan assessments and specialist help where needed.</li>\n					<li>Help them get organised and enjoy life.</li>\n				</ul>\n			</div>\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="accordion-wrap">\n			<h3>Is it true that ‘dyslexia’ is just another word for ‘slow’ or ‘not trying hard enough’?</h3><div class="empty"></div><div class="image-wrap"><img src="http://localhost/laravel-speldnz/public/asset/icons/plus.png" alt=""></div>\n			<div class="accordion-news">\n				<p>No, this isn’t true at all.

He didn''t want to go to school \n					and his self-esteem was at an all-time low. A friend \n					of mine suggested we approach SPELD. We had him \n					assessed and discovered he was dyslexic.

Gone are the \n					days when he would refuse to come out from beneath \n					the bed covers in the mornings! He is now a motivated, \n					hard-working Year 9 student whose latest exam results \n					blew us away. I credit SPELD with saving my son and \n					although he no longer needs a tutor I know that should \n					any problems arise they are only a phone call away.

(15, '"Success for SPELD NZ"', '<p>Pilot Research Program: looking at ourselves</p> 				<p>At the 2012 SPELD NZ Conference in Palmerston North we received some excellent news.  Dr Karen Waldie, a noted researcher, spoke about the results of the SPELD NZ Pilot Project(1).  Dr Waldie is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and Research Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Auckland.</p> 				<p>Having a well-regarded and independent academic analyse the results of the Pilot Project gives those results real credibility.  SPELD NZ professionals have the goal of making a difference for those with dyslexia.  These results indicate that the work and approach of SPELD NZ is at the very least heading in the right direction.</p> 				<p>In the course of her Conference presentation Dr Waldie commented that she had been impressed by the degree of difference that the research results highlighted. </p> 				<p>The Pilot Project had a sample size of 42 seven year old students. These students received a ‘before’ assessment using the Woodcock-Johnson III (WJIII) test battery, then 60forty-five minute sessions of 1:1 tuition, twice weekly. This remedial intervention was followed by another assessment using the same WJIII test battery.</p> 				<p>Although the sample size of 42 is not large, the analysis of the findings from the SPELD NZ Pilot Project is very encouraging indeed.  Ideally a similar project will be repeated in the future so as to demonstrate even more strongly the positive outcomes of SPELD NZ work.  It is hoped that these results can be used to support applications for funding for further research.</p> 				<p>At that time a similar key question would be asked, i.e. “Do students who are given SPELD tuition, perform significantly better at the second assessment, than they did at their first, for each Cognitive and Achievement test?” </p> 				<p>As noted above, when that question was asked in this Pilot Project, the results were very pleasing for all concerned.</p> 				<p>Dr Waldie carried out detailed statistical analyses on each test or cluster and on each dependent variable to show the effectiveness of SPELD NZ teaching. (A more detailed and academic report than is given here, will be available soon on the SPELD NZ website).</p> 				<p>In a summary form some of the main findings reported on included:</p> 				 				<ul> 					<li>All cognitive abilities improved significantly</li> 					<li>There were small but useful increases for students in verbal ability, phonemic awareness, cognitive efficiency and processing speed.</li> 					<li>There was an improvement in general intellectual ability.</li> 					<li>There was a significant improvement in thinking ability.  Thinking ability covers visual-auditory learning, spatial relations, sound blending, concept formation, retrieval fluency, picture recognition, auditory attention and Analysis-Synthesis.  This is a particularly useful area in which to be able to demonstrate student gains.</li> 					<li>Visual matching, number reversal, decision speed and memory for words aspects of cognitive efficiency did not show significant improvement.</li> 					<li>Student phonemic awareness showed significant development.</li> 				</ul>  				<p>Dr Waldie also carried out statistical analysis on the Success Rate Achievement results. </p> 				<p>All achievement skills improvedsignificantly.</p> 				<p>Broad reading skills, word identification and sounding out skills showed the most change.  Oral language, listening and spelling skills also showed development but not to the same degree. Overall, word attack scores improved significantly.</p> 				<p>That statistical analysis shows such satisfactory results for SPELD NZ intervention also has wider implications for students. Success leads to confidence and this is exemplified by many of the comments received at the end of the Pilot research programme.  Typical (unedited) comments included:</p> 				 				<ul> 					<li>“I feel better on the inside now.”</li> 					<li>“will happily write now”</li> 					<li>“massive improvements in behaviour and attitude”</li> 					<li>“Confidence has improved”.</li> 					<li>“He feels much happier to attempt to read words for himself”.</li> 					<li>“He feels proud when he achieves things for himself.”</li> 				</ul>  				<p>SPELD NZ has something to be proud of with the results of this research.  Although it is a first step, it indicates that the SPELD NZ approach is built on strong foundations and can make a strong contribution to those with dyslexia and to the wider education sector.</p> 				<p>These research results will be publicized and used to develop and underpin future work.  The time, energy and thought put into this project has resulted in SPELD NZ being able to look forward with confidence, just as those students involved in this piece of research can. </p> 				<p>(1)This article is closely based on the presentation of Dr Waldie.

As youngsters reach \r\n		 					adolescence, society expects them to become independent. The tension \r\n		 					between the expectation of independence and the child’s learned \r\n		 					dependence causes great internal conflicts. The adolescent dyslexic \r\n		 					uses his anger to break away from those people on which he feels so \r\n		 					dependent. Because of these factors, it may be difficult for parents \r\n		 					to help their teenage dyslexic. Instead, peer tutoring or a concerned \r\n		 					young adult may be better able to intervene and help the child.</li>\r\n		 					<li><span>Self Image</span>The dyslexic’s self-image appears to be \r\n		 					extremely vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. According to Erik \r\n		 					Erikson, during the first years of school, every child must resolve \r\n		 					the conflicts between a positive self-image and feelings of inferiority. \r\n		 					If children succeed in school, they will develop positive feelings about \r\n		 					themselves and believe that they can succeed in life. If children meet \r\n		 					failure and frustration, they learn that they are inferior to others, \r\n		 					and that their effort makes very little difference. Instead of feeling \r\n		 					powerful and productive, they learn that their environment controls them. \r\n		 					They feel powerless and incompetent. <br /><br />Researchers have learned \r\n		 					that when typical learners succeed, they credit their own efforts for their \r\n		 					success. When they fail, they tell themselves to try harder. However, when \r\n		 					the dyslexic succeeds, he is likely to attribute his success to luck. When \r\n		 					he fails, he simply sees himself as stupid.<br /><br />Research also suggests \r\n		 					that these feelings of inferiority develop by the age of ten. After this age, \r\n		 					it becomes extremely difficult to help the child develop a positive self-image. \r\n		 					This is a powerful argument for early intervention.</li>\r\n		 					<li><span>Depression</span>Depression is also a frequent complication in \r\n		 					Dyslexia. Although most dyslexics are not depressed, children with this \r\n		 					kind of learning disability are at higher risk for intense feelings of \r\n		 					sorrow and pain. Perhaps because of their low self-esteem, dyslexics are \r\n		 					afraid to turn their anger toward their environment and instead turn it \r\n		 					toward themselves. However, depressed children and adolescents often have \r\n		 					different symptoms than do depressed adults. The depressed child is unlikely \r\n		 					to be lethargic or to talk about feeling sad. Instead he or she may become \r\n		 					more active or misbehave to cover up the painful feelings. In the case of \r\n		 					masked depression, the child may not seem obviously unhappy. However, both \r\n		 					children and adults who are depressed tend to have three similar characteristics:\r\n		 					<br /><br />First, they tend to have negative thoughts about themselves, i.e. a \r\n		 					negative self-image. Second, they tend to view the world negatively. They are less \r\n		 					likely to enjoy the positive experiences in life. This makes it difficult for them \r\n		 					to have fun.<br /><br />Finally, most depressed youngsters have great trouble \r\n		 					imagining anything positive about the future. The depressed dyslexic not only \r\n		 					experiences great pain in his present experiences, but also foresees a life of \r\n		 					continuing failure.</li>\r\n		 					<li><span>Family Problems</span>Like any handicapping condition, Dyslexia has \r\n		 					a tremendous impact on the child’s family. However, because Dyslexia is an \r\n		 					invisible handicap, these effects are often overlooked. Dyslexia affects the \r\n		 					family in a variety of ways. One of the most obvious is sibling rivalry. \r\n		 					Non-dyslexic children often feel jealous of the dyslexic child, who gets the \r\n		 					majority of the parents’ attention, time, and money. Ironically, the dyslexic \r\n		 					child does not want this attention. This increases the chances that he or she \r\n		 					will act negatively against the achieving children in the family.<br /><br />Specific \r\n		 					developmental Dyslexia runs in families. This means that one or both of the child’s \r\n		 					parents may have had similar school problems. When faced with a child who is having \r\n		 					school problems, dyslexic parents may react in one of two ways. They may deny the \r\n		 					existence of Dyslexia and believe if the child would just buckle down, he or she \r\n		 					could succeed. Or, the parents may relive their failures and frustrations through \r\n		 					their child’s school experience. This brings back powerful and terrifying emotions, \r\n		 					which can interfere with the adult’s parenting skills.</li>'),
(11, 3, 'How can parents and teachers help?', '<p>Both teachers and parents need to offer consistent, ongoing encouragement \n		 					and support. However, one rarely hears about this very important way to help \n		 					youngsters. Encouragement involves at least four elements.</p>\n		 		\n		 					<ul>\n		 						<li>Listening to children’s feelings. Anxiety, anger and depression \n		 						are daily companions for dyslexics. However, their language problems \n		 						often make it difficult for them to express their feelings. Therefore, \n		 						adults must help them learn to talk about their feelings.</li>\n		 						<li>Teachers and parents must reward effort, not just “the product”. \n		 						For the dyslexic, grades should be less important than progress.</li>\n		 						<li>When confronting unacceptable behaviour, adults must not \n		 						inadvertently discourage the dyslexic child. Words such as “lazy” \n		 						or “incorrigible” can seriously damage the child’s self-image.</li>\n		 						<li>Help students set realistic goals for themselves. Most dyslexic \n		 						students set unattainable goals. By helping the child set an attainable \n		 						goal, teachers can change the cycle of failure.</li>\n		 						<li>Even more important, the child needs to recognize and rejoice in \n		 						his or her successes. To do so, he or she needs to achieve success in \n		 						some area of life. In some cases, the dyslexic’s strengths are obvious, \n		 						and many dyslexics’ self-esteem has been salvaged by prowess in athletics, \n		 						art, or mechanics. However, the dyslexic’s strengths are often more subtle \n		 						and less obvious. Parents and teachers need to find ways to relate the \n		 						child’s interests to the demands of real life.</li>\n		 						<li>Finally, many successful dyslexic adults deal with their own pain \n		 						by reaching out to others. They may do volunteer work for charities or \n		 						churches, or choose vocations that require empathy and a social conscience. \n		 						These experiences help dyslexics feel more positive about themselves and deal \n		 						more effectively with their pain and frustration. Many opportunities exist \n		 						in our schools, homes and churches for dyslexics to help others. One important \n		 						area is peer tutoring. If dyslexic students do well in math or science, \n		 						they can be asked to tutor a classmate who is struggling. Perhaps that student \n		 						can reciprocate as a reader for the dyslexic student. Tutoring younger children, \n		 						especially other dyslexics, can be a positive experience for everyone involved.</li>\n		 					</ul>\n		 		\n		 					<p>Helping dyslexics feel better about themselves and deal effectively with \n		 					their feelings is a complex task. First, caring adults must understand the \n		 					cognitive and affective problems caused by Dyslexia. Then they must design \n		 					strategies that will help the dyslexic, like every other child, to find joy \n		 					and success in academics and personal relationships.</p>\n		 					<p>Thank you to the International Dyslexia Association</p>'),

(17, 5, 'Are there characteristics that individuals with ADHD and Dyslexia have in common?', '<p>Dyslexic children and children with ADHD have some similar \r\n	 						characteristics. Dyslexic children, like children with ADHD, \r\n	 						may have difficulty paying attention because reading is so \r\n	 						demanding that it causes them to fatigue easily, limiting \r\n	 						the ability to sustain concentration. People with Dyslexia \r\n	 						and those with ADHD both have difficulty with reading.
